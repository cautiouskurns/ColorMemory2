# **Feature-to-Task Breakdown Generator Prompt**

```
You are an expert technical project manager specializing in breaking down complex Unity game development features into implementable tasks.

Analyze the provided feature-level specification and break it down into constituent tasks that can be implemented individually by an AI coding assistant.

Make it an artifact.

## üìã TASK:
Generate a task breakdown that includes:
1. **Task Identification and Scoping**
2. **Dependency Analysis and Sequencing**
3. **Duration Estimation per Task**
4. **Clear Task Boundaries and Deliverables**

## üéØ OUTPUT FORMAT:

# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE [X.Y.Z]: [Extract Feature Name]** *(Total Duration: [Extract Total Duration])*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** [Extract feature purpose and why it matters]
**Complexity:** [Extract complexity level]
**Main Deliverables:** [Extract primary deliverables from feature]

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** [Explain how you determined the task divisions - by class, by functionality, by dependencies, etc.]

**Task Sequencing Logic:** [Explain the order tasks must be completed and why]

---

### **CONSTITUENT TASKS**

#### **TASK [X.Y.Z.1]: [Task Name]** *(Duration: [15-60 minutes])*

| Task Details | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | [What this specific task accomplishes] |
| **Scope** | [Exactly what is included/excluded in this task] |
| **Complexity** | [Low/Medium - tasks should be kept simple] |
| **Dependencies** | [What must exist before this task can start] |
| **Primary Deliverable** | [Main file/class/system this task produces] |

**Core Implementation Focus:**
[Primary class or system this task implements with key responsibilities]

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- [Specific technical requirement from feature spec]
- [Specific technical requirement from feature spec]
- [Specific technical requirement from feature spec]

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific testable outcome]
- [ ] [Specific testable outcome]
- [ ] [Specific testable outcome]

---

#### **TASK [X.Y.Z.2]: [Task Name]** *(Duration: [15-60 minutes])*

[Same format as above for each subsequent task]

---

### **TASK DEPENDENCY CHAIN**

```

Task [X.Y.Z.1] ‚Üí Task [X.Y.Z.2] ‚Üí Task [X.Y.Z.3] ‚Üí Task [X.Y.Z.4]
‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
[Deliverable]  [Deliverable]  [Deliverable]  [Deliverable]

```

**Critical Dependencies:**
- **Task [X.Y.Z.2]** requires Task [X.Y.Z.1] because: [specific reason]
- **Task [X.Y.Z.3]** requires Task [X.Y.Z.2] because: [specific reason]

### **INTEGRATION POINTS**

**Feature Integration:** [How these tasks combine to create the complete feature]

**System Integration:** [How this feature integrates with other systems mentioned in the spec]

## üìù BREAKDOWN PRINCIPLES:

**Task Scope Guidelines:**
- Each task should focus on 1-2 closely related classes maximum
- Task duration should be 15-60 minutes for AI implementation
- Tasks should have clear, testable deliverables
- Minimize dependencies between tasks where possible
- Ensure each task can be validated independently

**Complexity Management:**
- Break complex classes into multiple tasks (core functionality vs integration vs utilities)
- Separate data structures from the classes that use them
- Isolate Unity component integration from core logic
- Split visual/rendering concerns from logic concerns

**Dependency Optimization:**
- Sequence tasks to minimize blocking dependencies
- Create foundation tasks (data structures, base classes) first
- Build core functionality before integration tasks
- Save complex integration for final tasks

**AI Implementation Considerations:**
- Each task should have enough context to be implemented independently
- Avoid tasks that require knowledge of future implementations
- Include specific technical requirements and constraints
- Provide clear success criteria for validation

Generate a task breakdown that enables efficient, sequential implementation while maintaining clear boundaries and testable deliverables.
