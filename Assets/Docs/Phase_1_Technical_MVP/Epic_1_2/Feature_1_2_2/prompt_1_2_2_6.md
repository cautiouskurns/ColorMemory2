# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Layout Pattern Implementation** *(45 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.2.6
**Category:** Feature
**Tags:** Patterns, Level Design, Procedural Generation, Gameplay
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Layout pattern generation algorithms within BrickGrid manager
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring varied brick arrangements for level progression and gameplay variety

**Purpose:** Implements multiple brick arrangement patterns including classic Breakout formations, geometric shapes, and randomized layouts to provide level variety and create engaging gameplay progression through different formation challenges.
**Complexity:** Medium complexity - 45 minutes (pattern algorithms with geometric calculations)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Add these methods to existing BrickGrid class
public class BrickGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Pattern Configuration")]
    [SerializeField] private LayoutPattern currentPattern = LayoutPattern.Standard;
    [SerializeField] private float patternDensity = 0.8f; // For random patterns
    [SerializeField] private bool hollowCenter = false; // For diamond patterns
    
    // Main pattern generation method
    public void GeneratePattern(LayoutPattern pattern)
    {
        // Switch between different pattern generation algorithms
    }
    
    // Pattern-specific generation methods
    private void GenerateStandardPattern()
    {
        // Classic Breakout brick wall - rows of bricks with type distribution
    }
    
    private void GeneratePyramidPattern()
    {
        // Triangular formation centered in play area
    }
    
    private void GenerateDiamondPattern()
    {
        // Diamond/rhombus shape with optional hollow center
    }
    
    private void GenerateRandomPattern()
    {
        // Random placement with density control and playability validation
    }
    
    // Utility methods
    private bool ShouldPlaceBrickAtPosition(int row, int column, LayoutPattern pattern)
    private BrickType GetBrickTypeForPosition(int row, int column, LayoutPattern pattern)
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Strategy pattern implementation for different layout generation algorithms
- Standard pattern creating classic Breakout brick wall formations with configurable rows
- Pyramid pattern generating centered triangular arrangements
- Diamond pattern creating geometric formations with hollow/filled options
- Random pattern producing varied layouts while maintaining playability constraints
- Pattern-specific brick type distribution based on position and formation requirements

### **Dependencies:**

- Scene hierarchy organization from Task 1.2.2.5 for proper brick placement
- Complete grid generation system including positioning and instantiation
- LayoutPattern enum and GridData configuration from Task 1.2.2.1

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Optimized pattern generation with efficient placement calculation algorithms
- Minimal computational overhead for complex geometric patterns
- Batch processing for large pattern generation without frame rate impact

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - each pattern method handles one formation type
- Use Strategy pattern for clean pattern algorithm separation
- Keep pattern methods focused without cross-pattern logic mixing
- Implement validation ensuring all patterns produce playable layouts

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Applies different arrangement patterns to existing brick grid system
**Scene Hierarchy:** Works with organized hierarchy from Task 1.2.2.5 for clean pattern placement
**Inspector Config:** Pattern selection and configuration options in organized Inspector sections
**System Connections:** Integrates all previous grid systems for complete layout generation

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering pattern algorithm approach and geometric calculation strategy)
2. **Code Files** (updated BrickGrid.cs with all pattern generation methods added)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (demonstrates all pattern types with test generation)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of pattern variety benefits and level design possibilities)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs` - add pattern methods to existing manager
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, clear algorithm documentation, geometric calculation comments

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1226CreateLayoutPatternSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Layout Pattern Implementation"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateLayoutPatternSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate complete grid system exists (call Task 1.2.2.5 setup if needed)
- Demonstrate all pattern types with test generation
- Configure pattern-specific parameters for each formation type
- Test pattern boundary validation and playability
- Show pattern variety and level design possibilities
- Validate geometric calculations for complex patterns

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateLayoutPatternSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Layout Pattern Implementation")]
    public static void CreateLayoutPatternImplementation()
    {
        // Validate prerequisites and call setup if needed
        // Demonstrate all pattern types with test configurations
        // Validate geometric calculations and boundary constraints
        // Show pattern variety for level design
        Debug.Log("âœ… Layout Pattern Implementation created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Layout Pattern Implementation", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateLayoutPatternImplementation()
    {
        // Return false if pattern system already implemented
        var grid = Object.FindObjectOfType<BrickGrid>();
        return grid != null; // Must have complete grid system
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**
