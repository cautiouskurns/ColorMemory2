# **TASK 1.2.2.5: Scene Hierarchy Organization** *(Low Complexity - 40 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.2.5 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Scene Management, Hierarchy, Organization, GameObject Management |
| **Dependencies** | Brick instantiation system (Task 1.2.2.4) |
| **Deliverable** | Organized scene hierarchy with proper parent-child relationships |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Creates parent containers (BrickGrid, Rows) for organization
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Implements structured parent-child relationships for clean scene management
- **Components:** GameObject organization and naming conventions
- **System Connections:** Organizes instantiated bricks, prepares for pattern implementation

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Generated bricks are properly organized under appropriate parent containers
- [ ] Scene hierarchy remains clean and navigable with clear naming conventions
- [ ] Row-based organization allows easy inspection and debugging of grid layout
- [ ] Hierarchy cleanup properly removes all generated objects during grid clearing
- [ ] Organization system scales efficiently with large grid configurations

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create parent GameObject containers for grid organization (BrickGrid, Rows, etc.)
- Implement hierarchical organization with row-based grouping for easy management
- Add naming conventions that clearly identify grid components and positions
- Include hierarchy cleanup system for grid clearing and regeneration
- Add scene hierarchy validation and debugging tools

**Technical Details:**
- Method: `GameObject CreateGridContainer()`
- Method: `GameObject CreateRowContainer(int rowIndex)`
- Method: `void OrganizeBricksInHierarchy()`
- Method: `void ClearHierarchy()`
- Parent GameObject creation and management
- Naming conventions: "BrickGrid", "Row_01", "Brick_R01_C03"
- Hierarchy cleanup and validation methods

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Composite pattern for hierarchical GameObject organization
- **Performance:** Efficient hierarchy management with minimal scene traversal
- **Resilience:** Robust cleanup system preventing memory leaks and orphaned objects

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs` - Hierarchy methods added to existing manager
- Scene organization working with instantiated bricks from Task 1.2.2.4
