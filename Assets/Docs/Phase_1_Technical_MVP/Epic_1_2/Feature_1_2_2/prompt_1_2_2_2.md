# **Unity C# Implementation Task: BrickGrid Manager Foundation** *(45 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.2.2
**Category:** System
**Tags:** MonoBehaviour, Manager, Grid System
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** BrickGrid MonoBehaviour manager class with core framework
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring centralized grid management for brick wall generation

**Purpose:** Creates the core management system for grid generation, provides configuration interface for designers, and establishes the framework for all grid-related operations including generation, clearing, and state tracking.
**Complexity:** Medium complexity - 45 minutes (MonoBehaviour with framework methods but no complex logic)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
public class BrickGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Grid Configuration")]
    [SerializeField] private GridData gridConfiguration;
    
    [Header("Runtime State")]
    [SerializeField] private bool gridGenerated;
    [SerializeField] private int brickCount;
    [SerializeField] private bool completionStatus;
    
    [Header("Hierarchy Management")]
    [SerializeField] private GameObject gridContainer;
    
    // Framework methods (stubs for now)
    public void GenerateGrid() { /* To be implemented in later tasks */ }
    public void ClearGrid() { /* To be implemented in later tasks */ }
    public bool ValidateGrid() { /* To be implemented in later tasks */ }
    
    // Unity lifecycle
    private void Awake() { /* Initialize grid manager */ }
    private void Start() { /* Setup initial state */ }
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- MonoBehaviour lifecycle management with proper initialization
- GridData configuration integration with Inspector exposure
- State tracking for grid generation status and brick counting
- Framework methods prepared for future implementation
- Parent GameObject reference management for hierarchy organization

### **Dependencies:**

- GridData structures from Task 1.2.2.1 (if missing, create placeholder structure)
- Unity MonoBehaviour and standard Unity components

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Minimal Update() overhead - avoid unnecessary frame-by-frame operations
- Efficient state management with cached references
- No garbage collection during normal operation

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus on grid management only
- Keep class manageable - framework setup without implementation details
- Use serialized fields for Inspector integration and debugging
- Prepare method stubs for future expansion without over-engineering

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** BrickGrid manager GameObject with BrickGrid component attached
**Scene Hierarchy:** Grid parent container setup preparation for hierarchy management
**Inspector Config:** Organized sections for Configuration, Runtime State, and Hierarchy Management
**System Connections:** Framework integrates with GridData, prepares for brick instantiation system

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering MonoBehaviour setup and framework approach)
2. **Code Files** (BrickGrid.cs with complete framework implementation)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (creates BrickGrid GameObject with component configuration)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of GridData integration and framework extensibility)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs`
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, XML documentation, Inspector organization with Header attributes

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1222CreateBrickGridManagerSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create BrickGrid Manager"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateBrickGridManagerSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Create BrickGrid GameObject in scene hierarchy
- Add BrickGrid component with proper configuration
- Set up default GridData reference if available
- Configure inspector default values for testing
- Position GameObject appropriately in scene
- Call Task 1.2.2.1 setup if GridData structures don't exist

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateBrickGridManagerSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create BrickGrid Manager")]
    public static void CreateBrickGridManager()
    {
        // Check for existing BrickGrid in scene
        // Create GameObject with BrickGrid component
        // Configure default settings and references
        // Position in scene hierarchy
        Debug.Log("âœ… BrickGrid Manager created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create BrickGrid Manager", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateBrickGridManager()
    {
        // Return false if BrickGrid already exists in scene
        return Object.FindObjectOfType<BrickGrid>() == null;
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log clear success/failure messages with GameObject creation details
- Handle missing GridData dependencies by calling prerequisite setup
- Validate component attachment completed successfully
- Provide instructions for manual configuration if automated setup fails

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate console output showing BrickGrid GameObject creation and component setup
- Provide instructions for configuring GridData parameters in Inspector
- List framework methods available and their intended future functionality

### **Documentation:**

- Create brief .md file capturing:
    - BrickGrid manager purpose and responsibilities
    - Inspector configuration options and their effects
    - Framework method stubs and their intended implementation
    - Integration with GridData configuration system

### **Custom Instructions:**

- Include helpful Inspector tooltips for configuration guidance
- Add validation methods for GridData configuration integrity
- Prepare logging system for debug information during grid operations

## **7. SUCCESS CRITERIA** *(When You're Done)*

### **Core Functionality:**

- [ ] BrickGrid MonoBehaviour initializes properly with GridData configuration
- [ ] Component exposes grid parameters in Inspector with organized sections
- [ ] Framework methods are prepared for grid generation and brick management
- [ ] Grid state tracking system ready for brick count and completion detection

### **Integration Tests:**

## **8. RESILIENCE FLAGS** *(Implementation Modifiers)*

**StubMissingDeps:** True - Create placeholder GridData if unavailable
**ValidationLevel:** Basic - Include basic state validation and error checking
**Reusability:** Reusable - Design for use across different levels and game modes

## **CONSTRAINTS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Unity Best Practices:**

- Cache component references during Awake() initialization
- Use SerializeField for Inspector visibility without public exposure
- Apply Header attributes for organized Inspector sections
- Minimize Update() overhead - no unnecessary frame operations
- Use proper MonoBehaviour lifecycle (Awake for setup, Start for initialization)

### **Performance Requirements:**

- Efficient state management with minimal memory allocation
- No garbage collection during normal grid operations
- Cached references to avoid repeated component lookups

### **Architecture Pattern:**

Manager pattern for centralized grid control with clear separation of concerns

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**

- **If GridData is missing:** Create minimal placeholder structure with basic grid parameters
- **If BrickData system unavailable:** Create placeholder BrickType enum for compilation
- **If folder structure missing:** Create required directories automatically

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Use sensible default values for all configuration parameters
- Log informative warnings for missing dependencies with clear resolution steps
- Gracefully initialize with minimal configuration rather than failing completely
