# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Scene Hierarchy Organization** *(40 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.2.5
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Scene Management, Hierarchy, Organization, GameObject Management
**Priority:** Medium

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Scene hierarchy organization system within BrickGrid manager
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring clean, navigable scene structure for debugging and management

**Purpose:** Organizes instantiated bricks into a clean, hierarchical structure with proper parent-child relationships, enables easy scene navigation and debugging, and provides efficient cleanup system for grid regeneration.
**Complexity:** Low complexity - 40 minutes (GameObject organization with naming conventions)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Add these methods and fields to existing BrickGrid class
public class BrickGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Hierarchy Organization")]
    [SerializeField] private GameObject gridContainer;
    [SerializeField] private GameObject[] rowContainers;
    [SerializeField] private string gridContainerName = "BrickGrid";
    [SerializeField] private string rowContainerPrefix = "Row_";
    
    // Hierarchy management methods
    public GameObject CreateGridContainer()
    {
        // Create main parent container for entire grid
    }
    
    public GameObject CreateRowContainer(int rowIndex)
    {
        // Create row-specific container with proper naming
    }
    
    public void OrganizeBricksInHierarchy()
    {
        // Organize all instantiated bricks under appropriate containers
    }
    
    public void ClearHierarchy()
    {
        // Clean up all generated containers and bricks
    }
    
    // Utility methods
    private string GetBrickName(int row, int column)
    private void ValidateHierarchyIntegrity()
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Parent GameObject container creation for grid organization
- Row-based grouping system for easy inspection and debugging
- Consistent naming conventions for all generated objects
- Hierarchy cleanup system preventing memory leaks and orphaned objects
- Scalable organization supporting large grid configurations

### **Dependencies:**

- Brick instantiation system from Task 1.2.2.4 for organizing created bricks
- BrickGrid manager with instantiated brick tracking
- Unity Transform hierarchy management

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient hierarchy management with minimal scene traversal overhead
- Fast cleanup operations without frame rate impact
- Scalable organization system supporting 100+ brick configurations

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus purely on organization, not creation
- Use Composite pattern for hierarchical GameObject management
- Keep hierarchy depth reasonable for performance and navigation
- Implement cleanup that prevents memory leaks and orphaned references

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Creates parent containers (BrickGrid, Row_01, Row_02, etc.) for organization
**Scene Hierarchy:** Implements clean, structured parent-child relationships for grid components
**Inspector Config:** Hierarchy management controls and naming configuration options
**System Connections:** Organizes bricks from instantiation system, prepares for pattern implementation

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering hierarchy organization approach and cleanup strategy)
2. **Code Files** (updated BrickGrid.cs with hierarchy management methods added)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (creates hierarchy containers and demonstrates organization)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of hierarchy benefits and navigation improvements)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs` - add hierarchy methods to existing manager
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, clear naming for scene navigation, efficient cleanup patterns

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1225CreateSceneHierarchyOrgSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Scene Hierarchy Organization"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateSceneHierarchyOrgSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate BrickGrid manager exists (call Task 1.2.2.4 setup if needed)
- Create sample hierarchy containers to demonstrate organization
- Set up naming conventions and container structure
- Test hierarchy cleanup and regeneration functionality
- Validate proper parent-child relationships in scene
- Demonstrate organization benefits with sample brick placement

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateSceneHierarchyOrgSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Scene Hierarchy Organization")]
    public static void CreateSceneHierarchyOrg()
    {
        // Validate prerequisites and call setup if needed
        // Create sample hierarchy containers
        // Demonstrate organization with test bricks
        // Validate cleanup functionality
        Debug.Log("âœ… Scene Hierarchy Organization created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Scene Hierarchy Organization", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateSceneHierarchyOrg()
    {
        // Return false if hierarchy system already set up
        var grid = Object.FindObjectOfType<BrickGrid>();
        return grid != null; // Must have BrickGrid to add hierarchy
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log hierarchy creation success with container counts and structure details
- Handle missing parent containers by creating them automatically
- Validate proper parent-child relationships and report any orphaned objects
- Provide clear cleanup confirmation with object destruction counts

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate console output showing hierarchy organization setup and structure benefits
- Provide instructions for navigating organized scene hierarchy during development
- List cleanup functionality and its importance for grid regeneration

### **Documentation:**

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**

- **If brick instantiation system missing:** Log error and provide setup instructions for Task 1.2.2.4
- **If BrickGrid manager unavailable:** Create minimal hierarchy management functionality
- **If scene containers missing:** Create default container structure automatically

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Create default container hierarchy when specific containers unavailable
- Use fallback naming conventions if custom names not configured
- Gracefully handle cleanup when some containers already destroyed
