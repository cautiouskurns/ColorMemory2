# **TASK 1.2.2.4: Brick Instantiation System** *(Medium Complexity - 55 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.2.4 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Instantiation, Prefabs, GameObject Creation, Grid System |
| **Dependencies** | Grid positioning mathematics (Task 1.2.2.3), Brick prefab from Feature 1.2.1 |
| **Deliverable** | Complete brick instantiation and positioning system |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Creates brick GameObjects from prefabs at calculated positions
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Instantiated bricks ready for hierarchy organization
- **Components:** Works with Brick MonoBehaviour from Feature 1.2.1
- **System Connections:** Uses positioning calculations, prepares for hierarchy management

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Brick instantiation creates properly configured GameObjects at calculated positions
- [ ] Batch generation efficiently creates entire grid layouts without performance issues
- [ ] Brick configuration system applies appropriate BrickData based on grid position
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages missing prefabs or configuration issues
- [ ] Instantiated bricks integrate properly with existing Brick MonoBehaviour system

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement brick instantiation: InstantiateBrick(Vector3 position, BrickType type)
- Add prefab reference management and validation for brick prefab requirements
- Create batch instantiation system for efficient grid generation
- Include brick configuration system that applies BrickData based on row/position
- Add instantiation error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Technical Details:**
- Method: `GameObject InstantiateBrick(Vector3 position, BrickType type)`
- Method: `void GenerateGridBricks()`
- Prefab reference fields with validation
- Batch instantiation with performance optimization
- BrickData configuration application during instantiation
- Error handling for missing prefabs and invalid configurations

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Factory pattern for brick creation with configuration injection
- **Performance:** Efficient batch instantiation with minimal garbage collection
- **Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs` - Instantiation methods added to existing manager
- Integration with Brick prefab and BrickData from Feature 1.2.1
