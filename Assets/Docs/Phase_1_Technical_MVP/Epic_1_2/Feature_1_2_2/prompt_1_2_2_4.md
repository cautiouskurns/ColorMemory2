# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Brick Instantiation System** *(55 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.2.4
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Instantiation, Prefabs, GameObject Creation, Grid System
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Brick GameObject creation and configuration system within BrickGrid manager
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring efficient brick wall generation from prefabs

**Purpose:** Creates the actual brick GameObjects from prefabs using calculated positions, applies proper configuration to each brick instance, and establishes efficient batch generation for complete grid layouts.
**Complexity:** Medium complexity - 55 minutes (prefab instantiation with configuration and error handling)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Add these methods and fields to existing BrickGrid class
public class BrickGrid : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Brick Prefabs")]
    [SerializeField] private GameObject brickPrefab;
    [SerializeField] private BrickData[] brickDataConfigurations;
    
    [Header("Instantiation Control")]
    [SerializeField] private Transform brickParent;
    [SerializeField] private List<GameObject> instantiatedBricks;
    
    // Core instantiation methods
    public GameObject InstantiateBrick(Vector3 position, BrickType type)
    {
        // Create brick GameObject at calculated position with proper configuration
    }
    
    public void GenerateGridBricks()
    {
        // Batch generate entire grid of bricks efficiently
    }
    
    // Configuration and validation
    private void ConfigureBrickInstance(GameObject brick, BrickType type)
    private bool ValidatePrefabReferences()
    private BrickData GetBrickDataForType(BrickType type)
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Individual brick instantiation using prefab references and position calculations
- Batch generation system for efficient creation of entire grid layouts
- Brick configuration system applying BrickData based on type and position
- Prefab reference validation with fallback mechanisms for missing assets
- Error handling for instantiation failures and invalid configurations

### **Dependencies:**

- Grid positioning mathematics from Task 1.2.2.3 for accurate placement
- Brick prefab and BrickData system from Feature 1.2.1
- BrickGrid manager foundation with state tracking capabilities

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient batch instantiation with minimal garbage collection
- Avoid excessive Instantiate() calls - batch operations where possible
- Minimal memory allocation during brick creation process

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus on instantiation and configuration only
- Use Factory pattern for brick creation with dependency injection
- Keep instantiation methods focused and avoid complex logic mixing
- Implement comprehensive error handling without performance penalties

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Creates brick GameObjects from prefabs at calculated grid positions
**Scene Hierarchy:** Instantiated bricks prepared for hierarchy organization in Task 1.2.2.5
**Inspector Config:** Prefab references and configuration arrays in organized Inspector sections
**System Connections:** Uses positioning calculations, integrates with Brick MonoBehaviour system

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering instantiation approach and batch generation strategy)
2. **Code Files** (updated BrickGrid.cs with instantiation system added)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (configures prefab references and creates test brick generation)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of Brick prefab integration and performance optimization)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Grid/BrickGrid.cs` - add instantiation methods to existing manager
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, proper prefab handling, comprehensive error checking

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1224CreateBrickInstantiationSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Instantiation System"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateBrickInstantiationSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate BrickGrid manager exists (call Task 1.2.2.3 setup if needed)
- Set up default brick prefab reference if available
- Configure BrickData array with sample configurations
- Create parent Transform for brick hierarchy organization
- Test instantiation system with sample grid generation
- Validate all component references and configurations

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateBrickInstantiationSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Instantiation System")]
    public static void CreateBrickInstantiationSystem()
    {
        // Validate prerequisites and call setup if needed
        // Configure prefab references and BrickData arrays
        // Set up parent Transform for brick organization
        // Test instantiation with sample configuration
        Debug.Log("âœ… Brick Instantiation System created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Instantiation System", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateBrickInstantiationSystem()
    {
        // Return false if system already configured
        var grid = Object.FindObjectOfType<BrickGrid>();
        return grid != null; // Must have BrickGrid to add instantiation
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log instantiation success/failure with specific brick counts
- Handle missing prefab references with clear error messages and fallback options
- Validate BrickData configuration availability and provide defaults if needed
- Report batch generation performance metrics and any optimization recommendations

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate console output showing instantiation system setup and test results
- Provide instructions for configuring brick prefab references in Inspector
- List performance optimization recommendations for large grid generation

### **Documentation:**

- Create brief .md file capturing:
    - Instantiation system architecture and approach
    - Prefab configuration requirements and setup
    - Batch generation performance characteristics
    - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### **Custom Instructions:**

- Include performance testing for large grid configurations (100+ bricks)
- Add instantiation validation to verify proper Brick component configuration
- Provide clear logging for debugging instantiation issues during development

## **CONSTRAINTS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Unity Best Practices:**

- Use Object pooling concepts for potential future optimization

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**

- **If Brick prefab missing:** Create basic cube GameObject with placeholder Brick component
- **If BrickData system unavailable:** Create default BrickData configuration for testing
- **If positioning mathematics missing:** Log error and provide setup instructions for Task 1.2.2.3

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Use Unity primitive GameObjects as fallback when prefabs unavailable
- Apply default configuration values when BrickData missing
