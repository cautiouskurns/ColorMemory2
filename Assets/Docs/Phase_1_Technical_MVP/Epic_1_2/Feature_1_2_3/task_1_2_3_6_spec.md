# **TASK 1.2.3.6: Power-up Spawning Foundation** *(Low Complexity - 35 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.6 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Power-ups, Spawning, Foundation, Framework |
| **Dependencies** | Brick tracking system (Task 1.2.3.4) for destruction event access and spawn triggering |
| **Deliverable** | PowerUpSpawner foundation framework with spawn triggering system |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** PowerUpSpawner GameObject with spawning component
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Power-up management container for spawning system
- **Components:** PowerUpSpawner MonoBehaviour with spawn triggering and position calculation
- **System Connections:** Subscribes to destruction events, provides foundation for Epic 1.3 power-up system

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] PowerUpSpawner framework provides clear interfaces for future power-up system integration
- [ ] Spawn triggering responds to brick destruction events with configurable probability settings
- [ ] Spawn position calculation accurately determines power-up placement based on destroyed brick location
- [ ] Framework establishes foundation for Epic 1.3 power-up system without implementing full functionality

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create PowerUpSpawner class framework with spawn triggering interfaces and basic spawn probability system
- Implement spawn point calculation based on destroyed brick position and collision data
- Add spawning event framework for communication with future power-up collection and effect systems
- Include spawning validation and configuration system for different power-up types and spawn rates

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/PowerUps/PowerUpSpawner.cs`
- PowerUpSpawner class framework with spawn triggering interfaces and probability system
- Spawn point calculation based on destroyed brick position and collision data
- Spawning event framework for future power-up collection and effect systems
- Spawning validation and configuration system for different power-up types and rates

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Foundation framework pattern with interfaces for future system expansion
- **Performance:** Lightweight spawning framework with minimal overhead
- **Resilience:** Configurable foundation that supports future Epic 1.3 power-up system integration

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/PowerUps/PowerUpSpawner.cs` - Main power-up spawning foundation framework
- `Assets/Scripts/PowerUps/PowerUpSpawnData.cs` - Spawn configuration data structures
