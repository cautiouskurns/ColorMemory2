# **TASK 1.2.3.2: CollisionManager Brick Extension** *(Medium Complexity - 55 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.2 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Collision, Manager, Integration, Routing |
| **Dependencies** | Collision event system foundation (Task 1.2.3.1) and existing CollisionManager from Epic 1.1 |
| **Deliverable** | Enhanced CollisionManager with brick collision handling methods |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Extends existing CollisionManager GameObject functionality
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Works with existing CollisionManager in scene
- **Components:** Enhanced CollisionManager MonoBehaviour with brick-specific collision handling
- **System Connections:** Integrates with existing Epic 1.1 collision framework and new event system

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] CollisionManager properly receives and processes brick collision events from existing Brick collision detection
- [ ] Collision routing directs ball-brick impacts to destruction system while maintaining performance
- [ ] Collision intensity and impact calculations provide consistent feedback for audio-visual systems
- [ ] Enhanced CollisionManager maintains compatibility with existing Epic 1.1 collision framework

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Add HandleBrickCollision() method to existing CollisionManager for processing brick collision events
- Implement collision routing that directs ball-brick collisions to appropriate destruction and feedback systems
- Add collision intensity calculation and impact force determination for consistent collision response
- Include collision validation and filtering to prevent duplicate or invalid collision processing

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Collision/CollisionManager.cs` - extend existing class
- HandleBrickCollision() method for processing brick collision events
- Collision routing logic for ball-brick impact direction
- Collision intensity and impact force calculation algorithms
- Collision validation and filtering mechanisms

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Extension of existing Manager pattern with specialized brick collision handling
- **Performance:** Efficient collision routing without performance degradation
- **Resilience:** Maintains compatibility with existing Epic 1.1 collision framework

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Collision/CollisionManager.cs` - Enhanced existing CollisionManager class
- Integration with event system from Task 1.2.3.1
