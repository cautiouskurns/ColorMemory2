# **TASK 1.2.3.4: Brick Tracking and Level Completion System** *(Medium Complexity - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.4 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Tracking, Level Completion, Game Progression, Events |
| **Dependencies** | Brick destruction event integration (Task 1.2.3.3) providing destruction notifications |
| **Deliverable** | BrickTracker system with level completion detection |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** BrickTracker GameObject with tracking component
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Level management container for tracking system
- **Components:** BrickTracker MonoBehaviour with event subscription and level completion detection
- **System Connections:** Subscribes to destruction events, communicates with future game state management systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] System accurately tracks remaining brick count through destruction event subscription
- [ ] Level completion is detected correctly when all destroyable bricks are eliminated
- [ ] Level completion events provide necessary data for future game state and progression systems
- [ ] Brick counting remains accurate even with rapid multiple destructions or edge case scenarios

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create BrickTracker class that subscribes to brick destruction events and maintains accurate brick count
- Implement level completion detection logic that identifies when all destroyable bricks have been cleared
- Add level completion event firing for communication with future game state management systems
- Include brick counting validation and error recovery for missed or duplicate destruction events

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Level/BrickTracker.cs`
- BrickTracker class with destruction event subscription and brick count maintenance
- Level completion detection logic for destroyable brick elimination
- Level completion event firing for game state communication
- Brick counting validation and error recovery mechanisms

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern for event subscription with tracking state management
- **Performance:** Efficient brick counting without frame-by-frame scene traversal
- **Resilience:** Robust counting validation with error recovery for edge cases

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Level/BrickTracker.cs` - Main brick tracking and level completion system
- Integration with destruction events from Task 1.2.3.3
