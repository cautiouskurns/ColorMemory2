# **TASK 1.2.3.1: Collision Event System Foundation** *(Medium Complexity - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.1 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Events, Communication, Architecture, UnityEvents |
| **Dependencies** | Basic Unity project setup and existing Brick/CollisionManager framework |
| **Deliverable** | BrickCollisionEvents system with UnityEvent integration |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** No direct GameObject creation - event system architecture only
- **Scene Hierarchy:** N/A for this task
- **Components:** Event system classes with UnityEvent integration for MonoBehaviour compatibility
- **System Connections:** Foundation for collision detection, brick destruction, scoring systems, and level completion tracking

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Event system supports brick destruction, damage, and collision event types with appropriate data structures
- [ ] Events can be subscribed to and fired reliably without memory leaks or performance impact
- [ ] Event data structures provide sufficient information for scoring, tracking, and future power-up systems
- [ ] Event system integrates seamlessly with Unity's component architecture and MonoBehaviour lifecycle

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create BrickCollisionEvents class with UnityEvent declarations for destruction, damage, and collision events
- Define collision event data structures with collision details, brick references, and impact information
- Implement event dispatcher/manager for centralized event coordination and subscription management
- Add event validation and error handling to prevent null reference exceptions and event system failures

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Events/BrickCollisionEvents.cs`
- UnityEvent declarations for destruction, damage, and collision events
- Event data structures with collision details, brick references, and impact information
- Event dispatcher/manager class for centralized coordination
- Event validation and error handling mechanisms

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern with UnityEvent system for decoupled communication
- **Performance:** Minimal memory allocation during event firing, efficient subscription management
- **Resilience:** Comprehensive error handling and null reference protection

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Events/BrickCollisionEvents.cs` - Main event system and data structures
- `Assets/Scripts/Events/CollisionEventData.cs` - Event data structure definitions
