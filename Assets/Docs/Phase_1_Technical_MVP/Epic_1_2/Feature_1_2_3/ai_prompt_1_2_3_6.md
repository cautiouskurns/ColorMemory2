# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Power-up Spawning Foundation** *(35 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.3.6
**Category:** Feature
**Tags:** Power-ups, Spawning, Foundation, Framework
**Priority:** Medium

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** PowerUpSpawner foundation framework with spawn triggering system
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring foundation framework for power-up spawning from destroyed bricks to enable future Epic 1.3 power-up system integration

**Purpose:** Creates foundation framework for power-up spawning from destroyed bricks, provides spawning interfaces and basic structure for future power-up system integration, with spawn triggering based on brick destruction events and configurable spawn probability.
**Complexity:** Low complexity - 35 minutes (foundation framework with interfaces, no full implementation)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public struct PowerUpSpawnData
{
    public Vector3 spawnPosition;
    public PowerUpType powerUpType;
    public float spawnProbability;
    public BrickType sourceBrickType;
    public System.DateTime spawnTimestamp;
}

public enum PowerUpType
{
    None,
    ExtraLife,
    PaddleExpand,
    MultiBall,
    SlowBall,
    StickyPaddle,
    Powerball
}

public class PowerUpSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Spawn Configuration")]
    [SerializeField] private bool enablePowerUpSpawning = true;
    [SerializeField] private float basePowerUpChance = 0.15f;
    [SerializeField] private PowerUpSpawnConfig[] spawnConfigurations;
    
    [Header("Spawn Validation")]
    [SerializeField] private bool validateSpawnPositions = true;
    [SerializeField] private LayerMask spawnObstacles;
    
    private BrickCollisionEvents eventSystem;
    private Queue<PowerUpSpawnData> pendingSpawns;
    
    [System.Serializable]
    public class PowerUpSpawnEvent : UnityEvent<PowerUpSpawnData> { }
    public PowerUpSpawnEvent OnPowerUpSpawnTriggered;
    
    // Foundation framework methods
    public bool ShouldSpawnPowerUp(BrickEventData brickData)
    public Vector3 CalculateSpawnPosition(BrickEventData brickData)
    public PowerUpType DeterminePowerUpType(BrickEventData brickData)
    public void TriggerPowerUpSpawn(PowerUpSpawnData spawnData)
    
    // Framework interfaces for Epic 1.3 integration
    public interface IPowerUpFactory
    {
        GameObject CreatePowerUp(PowerUpType type, Vector3 position);
    }
    
    public interface IPowerUpCollector
    {
        void OnPowerUpCollected(PowerUpType type);
    }
}

[System.Serializable]
public struct PowerUpSpawnConfig
{
    public BrickType triggerBrickType;
    public PowerUpType powerUpType;
    public float spawnProbability;
    public bool requiresSpecialConditions;
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Spawn triggering based on brick destruction events with configurable probability
- Spawn position calculation based on destroyed brick position and collision data
- Power-up type determination using spawn configuration and brick type mapping
- Spawning event framework for communication with future power-up collection systems
- Foundation interfaces for Epic 1.3 power-up system integration

### **Dependencies:**

- Brick tracking system from Task 1.2.3.4 for destruction event access
- BrickCollisionEvents system for event subscription
- Foundation for future Epic 1.3 power-up system implementation

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Lightweight spawning framework with minimal overhead
- Efficient spawn probability calculations without frame rate impact
- Minimal memory allocation during spawn triggering

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus on spawning foundation only
- Keep framework interfaces clean for future Epic 1.3 integration
- Use configurable spawn system for flexible power-up distribution
- Implement foundation without full power-up functionality

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** PowerUpSpawner GameObject with spawning component
**Scene Hierarchy:** Power-up management container for spawning system organization
**Inspector Config:** Spawn configuration arrays and probability settings with organized sections
**System Connections:** Subscribes to destruction events, provides foundation for Epic 1.3 power-up system

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering foundation approach and spawn triggering strategy)
2. **Code Files** (complete PowerUpSpawner foundation framework with interfaces)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (creates spawning system and demonstrates foundation functionality)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of Epic 1.3 integration readiness and framework benefits)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/PowerUps/PowerUpSpawner.cs`, `Assets/Scripts/PowerUps/PowerUpSpawnData.cs`
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, foundation framework documentation, clear interface definitions

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1236CreatePowerUpSpawningSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Power-up Spawning Foundation"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreatePowerUpSpawningSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate brick tracking system exists (call Task 1.2.3.4 setup if needed)
- Create PowerUpSpawner GameObject with foundation component
- Configure spawn probability settings and power-up type mappings
- Set up event subscription to brick destruction events
- Test spawn triggering with sample destruction scenarios

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreatePowerUpSpawningSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Power-up Spawning Foundation")]
    public static void CreatePowerUpSpawningFoundation()
    {
        // Validate prerequisites and call setup if needed
        // Create PowerUpSpawner GameObject and configure component
        // Set up spawn configurations and probability settings
        // Test spawn triggering and foundation functionality
        Debug.Log("âœ… Power-up Spawning Foundation created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Power-up Spawning Foundation", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreatePowerUpSpawningFoundation()
    {
        return Object.FindFirstObjectByType<PowerUpSpawner>() == null;
    }
}
