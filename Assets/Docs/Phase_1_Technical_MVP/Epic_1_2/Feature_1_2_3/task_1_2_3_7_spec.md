| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.7 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Utility |
| **Tags** | Testing, Validation, Integration, Quality Assurance |
| **Dependencies** | All previous collision integration tasks (1.2.3.1-1.2.3.6) completed and working |
| **Deliverable** | Complete integration testing suite with validation tools and performance metrics |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Testing utilities and validation GameObjects for collision integration verification
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Test environment setup for collision integration validation
- **Components:** Testing and validation components with debugging utilities
- **System Connections:** Validates entire collision integration system functionality and reliability

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**
