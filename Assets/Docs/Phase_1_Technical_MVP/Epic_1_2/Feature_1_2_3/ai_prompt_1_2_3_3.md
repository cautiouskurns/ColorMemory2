# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Brick Destruction Event Integration** *(50 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.3.3
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Destruction, Events, Integration, Communication
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Complete brick destruction event integration with data communication
**Game Context:** Breakout-style game requiring automatic event firing when bricks are destroyed to enable scoring, tracking, and future power-up spawning

**Purpose:** Connects existing brick destruction logic to the event system, enabling communication with scoring systems, level completion tracking, and future power-up systems through comprehensive event data population.
**Complexity:** Medium complexity - 50 minutes (event integration with existing destruction mechanics)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Extension to existing Brick class
public partial class Brick : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Event Integration")]
    [SerializeField] private bool enableEventFiring = true;
    [SerializeField] private bool enableDestructionLogging = true;
    
    private BrickCollisionEvents eventSystem;
    private Queue<BrickEventData> pendingEvents;
    private bool isProcessingDestruction = false;
    
    // Event integration methods
    private void FireDestructionEvent(Collision2D collision)
    {
        // Fire destruction event with complete brick and collision data
    }
    
    private void FireDamageEvent(Collision2D collision, int damageAmount)
    {
        // Fire damage event when brick takes damage but isn't destroyed
    }
    
    private BrickEventData CreateEventData(Collision2D collision, string eventType)
    {
        // Create comprehensive event data with brick and collision information
    }
    
    // Event timing and validation
    private void ProcessPendingEvents()
    private bool ValidateEventData(BrickEventData eventData)
    private void HandleEventFireFailure(BrickEventData eventData, string reason)
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Integration with existing Brick destruction logic to fire events automatically
- Event data population including brick type, position, collision point, and destruction cause
- Event timing and sequencing to handle rapid multiple brick destructions
- Event communication validation and fallback handling for missing subscribers
- Queue-based event processing to prevent event system overload

### **Dependencies:**

- BrickCollisionEvents system from Task 1.2.3.1 for event firing
- CollisionManager extension from Task 1.2.3.2 for collision coordination
- Existing Brick destruction mechanics from Feature 1.2.1

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient event firing without impacting destruction mechanics performance
- Minimal memory allocation during event data creation
- No frame rate impact during rapid multiple brick destructions

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - integrate events without changing core destruction logic
- Keep event firing focused on data communication only
- Use event validation to ensure reliable communication
- Implement fallback handling for missing event subscribers

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Modifies existing Brick GameObjects to fire destruction events
**Scene Hierarchy:** Works with existing brick hierarchy from Feature 1.2.1
**Inspector Config:** Event integration settings with debugging options
**System Connections:** Connects destruction mechanics to centralized event system for scoring and tracking

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering event integration approach and destruction coordination)
2. **Code Files** (enhanced Brick class with event integration methods)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (configures existing bricks with event integration)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of destruction event workflow and data communication)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - enhance existing Brick class
**Code Standards:** Unity C# conventions, maintain existing destruction logic, comprehensive event documentation

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/Task1233CreateBrickEventIntegrationSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Event Integration"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateBrickEventIntegrationSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate BrickCollisionEvents system exists (call Task 1.2.3.1 setup if needed)
- Configure existing Brick GameObjects with event integration settings
- Set up event system references on all brick instances
- Test event firing with sample destruction scenarios
- Validate event data population and communication workflow

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateBrickEventIntegrationSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Event Integration")]
    public static void CreateBrickEventIntegration()
    {
        // Validate prerequisites and call setup if needed
        // Configure existing bricks with event integration
        // Set up event system references and validation
        // Test event firing and data communication
        Debug.Log("âœ… Brick Event Integration created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Event Integration", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateBrickEventIntegration()
    {
        return Object.FindFirstObjectByType<BrickCollisionEvents>() != null;
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log event integration setup success with brick count and configuration details
- Handle missing event system with clear setup instructions
- Validate event data population and provide debugging guidance
- Report event firing test results and communication verification
