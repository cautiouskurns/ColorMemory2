# **TASK 1.2.3.3: Brick Destruction Event Integration** *(Medium Complexity - 50 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.3.3 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Destruction, Events, Integration, Communication |
| **Dependencies** | Collision event system (Task 1.2.3.1) and CollisionManager brick extension (Task 1.2.3.2) working |
| **Deliverable** | Complete brick destruction event integration with data communication |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Modifies existing Brick GameObjects to fire destruction events
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Works with existing brick hierarchy from Feature 1.2.1
- **Components:** Enhanced Brick MonoBehaviour with event firing capabilities
- **System Connections:** Connects destruction mechanics to centralized event system for scoring and tracking

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Brick destruction automatically fires destruction events with complete collision and brick information
- [ ] Event data includes all necessary information for scoring, tracking, and future power-up spawning
- [ ] Multiple rapid brick destructions are handled correctly without event system overload
- [ ] Event firing integrates smoothly with existing Brick destruction mechanics without breaking functionality

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Modify existing Brick destruction logic to fire destruction events with collision and brick data
- Implement event data population including brick type, position, collision point, and destruction cause
- Add destruction event timing and sequencing to handle rapid multiple brick destructions
- Include event communication validation and fallback handling for missing event subscribers

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - modify existing Brick class
- Event firing from destruction logic with collision and brick data
- Event data population with brick type, position, collision point, and destruction cause
- Destruction event timing and sequencing for rapid multiple destructions
- Event communication validation and fallback handling

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Event-driven architecture with publisher-subscriber communication
- **Performance:** Efficient event firing without impacting destruction mechanics performance
- **Resilience:** Robust event communication with validation and fallback handling

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - Enhanced existing Brick class with event integration
- Uses event system from Task 1.2.3.1 and CollisionManager from Task 1.2.3.2
