## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Addition to existing CollisionManager class
public partial class CollisionManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Performance Optimization")]
    [SerializeField] private bool enableCollisionBatching = true;
    [SerializeField] private int maxCollisionsPerFrame = 5;
    [SerializeField] private float collisionProcessingTimeLimit = 0.016f; // 16ms target
    [SerializeField] private bool enablePerformanceMonitoring = true;
    
    // Collision batching and queuing
    private Queue<CollisionProcessingTask> collisionQueue;
    private List<CollisionProcessingTask> currentFrameBatch;
    private Coroutine collisionProcessingCoroutine;
    
    [System.Serializable]
    public struct CollisionProcessingTask
    {
        public Collision2D collision;
        public Brick brick;
        public float priority;
        public System.DateTime timestamp;
    }
    
    // Performance optimization methods
    public void ProcessCollisionBatch()
    public void QueueCollisionForProcessing(Collision2D collision, Brick brick, float priority = 1.0f)
    private bool ShouldBatchCollision()
    private void OptimizeCollisionProcessing()
    
    // Performance monitoring
    private CollisionPerformanceMonitor performanceMonitor;
    private void UpdatePerformanceMetrics()
}

public class CollisionPerformanceMonitor : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Performance Metrics")]
    [SerializeField] private float averageProcessingTime = 0f;
    [SerializeField] private int collisionsPerSecond = 0;
    [SerializeField] private float frameTimeImpact = 0f;
    
    public void RecordCollisionProcessing(float processingTime)
    public void ValidatePerformanceGoals()
    public PerformanceReport GeneratePerformanceReport()
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Collision event batching for processing multiple simultaneous brick collisions efficiently
- Collision processing queue management to prevent frame rate drops during collision-heavy scenarios  
- Performance monitoring and validation tools for measuring collision processing efficiency
- Collision throttling and rate limiting to maintain consistent performance
- Time-based processing limits to preserve frame rate targets

### **Dependencies:**

- CollisionManager extension from Task 1.2.3.2 for collision handling
- Brick destruction event integration from Task 1.2.3.3 for event processing
- Unity's Coroutine system for frame-distributed processing

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Maintain 60 FPS target during collision-heavy scenarios
- Limit collision processing to 16ms per frame maximum
- Minimize garbage collection during optimization operations

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus purely on performance optimization
- Keep optimization methods separate from core collision logic
- Use queue-based processing for frame rate stability
- Implement comprehensive performance monitoring for validation

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** No new GameObjects - optimization of existing collision system
**Scene Hierarchy:** N/A for this task
**Inspector Config:** Performance settings and monitoring displays with organized sections
**System Connections:** Optimizes collision handling and event processing for scalability

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

2. **Code Files** (enhanced CollisionManager with optimization methods and performance monitor)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (configures performance optimization and demonstrates stress testing)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of optimization benefits and performance validation)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Collision/CollisionManager.cs` - add optimization methods, `Assets/Scripts/Performance/CollisionPerformanceMonitor.cs`

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR

        // Configure performance optimization on CollisionManager
        // Set up performance monitoring and metrics tracking
        // Test collision batching and stress scenarios
        Debug.Log("âœ… Collision Performance Optimization created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Collision Performance Optimization", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateCollisionOptimization()
    {
