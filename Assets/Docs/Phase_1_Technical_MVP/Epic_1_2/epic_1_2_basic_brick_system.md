# **EPIC 1.2: BASIC BRICK SYSTEM** *(2 weeks)*

## **Epic Overview**

| Epic Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Risk Level** | Medium |
| **Purpose** | Establishes the fundamental brick mechanics that enable core gameplay - creating destroyable targets arranged in grid patterns that respond to ball collisions and provide the foundation for scoring and level progression systems. |
| **Dependencies** | Epic 1.1: Core Physics Foundation complete with CollisionManager and ball-paddle collision system working |

**Playable State After Epic:** Player can launch ball and destroy bricks arranged in grid patterns, each brick destroyed provides satisfying visual/audio feedback, collision detection between ball and bricks works reliably, brick destruction creates clear progress toward level completion goal.

## **FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS**

### **FEATURE 1.2.1: BRICK GAMEOBJECT SYSTEM** *(28 hours)*

**Purpose:** Creates the core individual brick behavior that handles collision detection, destruction mechanics, and provides immediate visual feedback when destroyed by the ball.

**Technical Approach:** Unity GameObject with Collider2D components integrated with existing physics layer system, destruction logic triggered by CollisionManager events, particle effects and audio feedback for destruction.

**Core Deliverables:**
- Brick MonoBehaviour with collision detection and destruction logic
- Brick GameObject prefab with proper physics layer assignment and visual components
- Destruction effect system with particle effects and audio feedback
- Integration with CollisionManager for consistent collision response
- Foundation for different brick types and scoring values

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Individual bricks respond consistently to ball collision with immediate destruction
- [ ] Brick destruction triggers satisfying visual and audio feedback effects
- [ ] Collision detection works reliably at all ball speeds without missed hits
- [ ] Destroyed bricks are properly removed from scene and memory
- [ ] Brick system integrates seamlessly with existing CollisionManager framework

### **FEATURE 1.2.2: GRID LAYOUT GENERATOR** *(24 hours)*

**Purpose:** Implements systematic brick arrangement in grid patterns that creates the classic Breakout brick wall formation with configurable layouts for different levels.

**Technical Approach:** Procedural grid generation system that creates and positions brick GameObjects in organized rows and columns, with configurable spacing, brick types, and pattern variations.

**Core Deliverables:**
- BrickGrid manager class that handles grid creation and brick positioning
- Configurable grid parameters (rows, columns, spacing, brick types)
- Grid positioning system that centers brick formation in play area
- Foundation for different level layouts and brick arrangement patterns
- Integration with scene hierarchy for organized brick management

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Grid system creates consistent brick layouts with proper spacing and alignment
- [ ] Brick formations are centered and positioned correctly within game boundaries
- [ ] Grid generator supports different row/column configurations for level variety
- [ ] All generated bricks are properly organized in scene hierarchy
- [ ] Grid system provides foundation for tracking remaining bricks for level completion

### **FEATURE 1.2.3: COLLISION INTEGRATION** *(20 hours)*

**Purpose:** Integrates brick destruction mechanics with the existing collision system and establishes the foundation for scoring, level completion detection, and future power-up spawning.

**Technical Approach:** Extension of CollisionManager to handle brick-specific collision events, brick destruction tracking system, and event-driven communication for scoring and level progression systems.

**Core Deliverables:**
- Enhanced CollisionManager with brick collision handling and destruction coordination
- Brick destruction tracking system that monitors remaining bricks for level completion
- Event system for communicating brick destruction to future scoring systems
- Foundation for power-up spawning from destroyed bricks in later epics
- Integration testing to ensure collision system handles brick destruction reliably

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] CollisionManager properly routes ball-brick collisions to destruction system
- [ ] Brick destruction events are tracked and communicated to other systems
- [ ] System accurately counts remaining bricks for level completion detection
- [ ] Collision integration maintains consistent performance with multiple simultaneous brick hits
- [ ] Foundation established for scoring system integration in future epics

## **Epic Integration**

**System Architecture:** The Basic Brick System creates a three-layer architecture where individual Brick GameObjects handle their own destruction logic, BrickGrid manages layout and positioning, and enhanced CollisionManager coordinates brick-ball interactions while tracking destruction events for level progression.

**Dependencies on Other Epics:** Requires Epic 1.1 Core Physics Foundation with working CollisionManager, physics layers, and ball collision detection. Depends on established physics performance and collision response framework.

**Provides to Other Epics:** Delivers destroyable brick targets that enable level completion mechanics, establishes foundation for scoring system integration, provides framework for power-up spawning from destroyed bricks, and creates the core gameplay loop progression from brick destruction to level advancement.
