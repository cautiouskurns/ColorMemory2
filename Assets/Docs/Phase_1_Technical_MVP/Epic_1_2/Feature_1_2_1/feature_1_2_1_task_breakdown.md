# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.2.1: BRICK GAMEOBJECT SYSTEM** *(Total Duration: 28 hours)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Creates the core individual brick behavior that handles collision detection, destruction mechanics, and provides immediate visual feedback when destroyed by the ball for satisfying arcade gameplay.
**Complexity:** Medium - requires Unity component integration, collision system coordination, and visual/audio feedback systems
**Main Deliverables:** Brick MonoBehaviour class, brick prefab with physics integration, destruction effect system, CollisionManager integration

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Divided by system responsibility - starting with foundational data structures, building core brick behavior, adding collision detection, implementing destruction mechanics, integrating visual/audio feedback, and finally creating the configured prefab for scene use.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Data structures provide foundation for all brick logic, core MonoBehaviour establishes GameObject behavior framework, collision detection enables brick-ball interaction, destruction logic handles removal mechanics, feedback systems enhance player experience, and prefab creation packages everything for deployment.

### **INTEGRATION POINTS**

**Feature Integration:** These tasks combine to create a complete brick GameObject system where data structures define brick behavior, MonoBehaviour manages state and lifecycle, collision detection enables ball interaction, destruction mechanics handle removal, visual and audio effects provide feedback, and prefab assembly packages everything for deployment.

**System Integration:** This feature integrates with CollisionManager from Epic 1.1 for collision coordination, physics layer system for collision filtering, and provides foundation for BrickGrid system (Feature 1.2.2) to instantiate and manage brick arrangements. Establishes event system for future scoring integration and power-up spawning in subsequent epics.
