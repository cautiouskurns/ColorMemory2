# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Brick MonoBehaviour Core Logic** *(45 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.1.2
**Category:** System
**Tags:** MonoBehaviour, Unity Components, State Management
**Priority:** Critical

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Brick MonoBehaviour class with state management and framework methods
**Game Context:** Breakout arcade game requiring individual brick behavior and lifecycle management

**Purpose:** Creates the core Unity component that manages individual brick state, configuration, and provides the foundation framework for collision detection and destruction logic in later tasks.
**Complexity:** Medium - Unity component integration with state management and Inspector configuration

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
public class Brick : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Configuration")]
    [SerializeField] private BrickData brickData;
    
    [Header("State")]
    [SerializeField] private int currentHitPoints;
    [SerializeField] private bool isDestroyed = false;
    
    [Header("Debug")]
    [SerializeField] private BrickType currentBrickType;
    
    // Initialization
    public void Initialize(BrickData data) { }
    
    // Framework methods (stubs for future implementation)
    public void OnCollisionDetected() { }
    public void OnDestroy() { }
    
    // Unity lifecycle
    private void Awake() { }
    private void Start() { }
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle with proper Awake/Start initialization sequence
- BrickData-based initialization system with validation and default value assignment
- State management tracking hit points, destruction status, and brick type
- Framework method stubs that prepare for collision detection and destruction implementation
- Inspector integration with organized sections and serialized field exposure

### **Dependencies:**

- BrickData structures from Task 1.2.1.1 (required)
- If BrickData missing: Create minimal stub structure with basic properties
- Unity MonoBehaviour and serialization system

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient state management with minimal per-frame overhead
- No continuous Update() calls unless required for future functionality
- Lightweight initialization and memory usage per brick instance

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - brick behavior and state management only
- Keep MonoBehaviour focused on Unity integration and lifecycle management
- Only implement properties and methods explicitly required by specification
- Avoid adding collision or destruction logic - save for future tasks

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Foundation for brick GameObjects with Brick component attached
**Scene Hierarchy:** Prepares brick objects for future grid placement under BrickGrid parent
**Inspector Config:** Organized sections with [Header] attributes for Configuration, State, and Debug
**System Connections:** Provides framework for collision detection and destruction integration

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering MonoBehaviour setup, initialization system, state management, Inspector organization, and framework preparation)
2. **Code Files** (Brick.cs with complete MonoBehaviour implementation)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (creates test brick GameObject with component for validation)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of how this provides foundation for collision and destruction systems)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs`
**Code Standards:** Unity MonoBehaviour conventions, [Header] organization, comprehensive XML documentation

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/1211CreateBrickComponentSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Brick Component"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateBrickComponentSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Create test brick GameObject with Brick component attached
- Configure component with default BrickData values
- Position GameObject for testing and validation
- Add visual components (SpriteRenderer) for scene visibility
- Validate component initialization and Inspector integration
- Handle missing BrickData dependencies gracefully

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate detailed console output showing Brick component creation and configuration
- List all state properties and their default values
- Provide testing instructions for validating initialization and state management
- Include framework method preparation status for future collision implementation

### **Documentation:**

- Create brief .md file capturing:
  - Brick MonoBehaviour architecture and responsibilities
  - Initialization system usage and BrickData integration
  - State management properties and their purposes
  - Framework methods prepared for future collision/destruction logic

### **Custom Instructions:**

- Add comprehensive validation in Initialize() method with error handling
- Include Debug.Log statements for initialization success/failure tracking
- Create helper properties for accessing brick state from external systems

## **7. SUCCESS CRITERIA** *(When You're Done)*

### **Core Functionality:**

- [ ] Brick MonoBehaviour initializes properly with BrickData configuration
- [ ] Component exposes appropriate properties in Inspector with clear organization
- [ ] State management system tracks hit points and destruction status correctly
- [ ] Framework ready for collision detection and destruction implementation

### **Integration Tests:**

- [ ] Brick component can be added to GameObject and configured in Inspector
- [ ] Initialize() method properly sets up brick state from BrickData
- [ ] State properties update correctly and are visible in Inspector

### **Quality Gates:**

- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Follows Unity MonoBehaviour best practices
- [ ] Classes are focused on component behavior only
- [ ] Clear Inspector organization with appropriate [Header] attributes

## **8. RESILIENCE FLAGS** *(Implementation Modifiers)*

**StubMissingDeps:** Basic - create minimal BrickData stub if missing with clear logging
**ValidationLevel:** Strict - validate all initialization parameters and state changes
**Reusability:** Reusable - component should work with different BrickData configurations

## **CONSTRAINTS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Unity Best Practices:**

- Use [SerializeField] for private fields that need Inspector exposure
- Implement proper Unity lifecycle (Awake for references, Start for initialization)
- Use [Header] attributes for clear Inspector organization
- Add comprehensive XML documentation for public methods
- Cache references during initialization rather than searching each frame

### **Performance Requirements:**

- Initialization completes within single frame without performance impact
- No continuous processing unless required for future functionality
- Efficient memory usage per brick instance

### **Architecture Pattern:**

- Component pattern with Unity MonoBehaviour integration and data-driven configuration

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**

- **If BrickData structures missing:** Create minimal stub with basic properties and log setup instructions
- **If Unity serialization not working:** Use public fields as fallback with warnings
- **If Inspector not showing fields:** Add troubleshooting guidance for common serialization issues

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Initialize with safe default values if BrickData configuration fails
- Log informative warnings for missing or invalid configuration
- Continue component functionality even with incomplete setup
