# **TASK 1.2.1.4: DESTRUCTION MECHANICS IMPLEMENTATION** *(Medium - 55 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.1.4 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Destruction Logic, Memory Management, Event System |
| **Dependencies** | Collision detection integration working (Task 1.2.1.3) |
| **Deliverable** | Complete destruction mechanics with proper cleanup |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Handles proper destruction and removal of brick GameObjects from scene
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Manages cleanup of destroyed bricks from grid hierarchy
- **Components:** Coordinates destruction of all brick components and references
- **System Connections:** Communicates destruction events to CollisionManager and future scoring systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Brick destruction triggers reliably when hit points reach zero
- [ ] GameObject is properly removed from scene and memory
- [ ] Destruction events are fired for external system coordination
- [ ] Multiple destruction calls are handled gracefully without errors
- [ ] Memory cleanup prevents leaks and dangling references

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement destruction triggering logic when hit points reach zero with proper validation
- Add proper GameObject destruction using Unity's Destroy() method with cleanup timing
- Implement destruction event system for external system notification and tracking
- Add validation to prevent multiple destruction calls and handle edge cases gracefully
- Include comprehensive memory management and reference cleanup for optimal performance

**Technical Details:**
- Methods: TriggerDestruction(), CleanupReferences(), OnDestroyed()
- Destruction logic: if (currentHitPoints <= 0 && !isDestroyed) TriggerDestruction()
- GameObject removal: Destroy(gameObject, destructionDelay) with configurable delay
- Event system: System.Action OnBrickDestroyed event for external subscribers
- Validation: isDestroyed flag prevents multiple destruction calls
- Memory cleanup: Null reference assignments and event unsubscription

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern for destruction event notification with cleanup validation
- **Performance:** Efficient destruction with minimal frame impact and proper memory management
- **Resilience** | Robust destruction handling with multiple-call protection and comprehensive cleanup

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - Extended with destruction mechanics, event system, and memory management
