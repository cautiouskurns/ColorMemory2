# **TASK 1.2.1.7: BRICK PREFAB ASSEMBLY** *(Low - 40 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.1.7 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Prefab Creation, Configuration, Deployment |
| **Dependencies** | All previous brick system tasks completed (Tasks 1.2.1.1-1.2.1.6) |
| **Deliverable** | Complete brick prefab ready for grid deployment |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Creates configured brick prefab with all required components
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Prefab ready for instantiation under BrickGrid parent containers
- **Components:** Brick, SpriteRenderer, Collider2D, ParticleSystem, AudioSource properly configured
- **System Connections:** Integrated with physics layer system and ready for CollisionManager coordination

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Brick prefab includes all required components properly configured
- [ ] Physics layer assignment matches collision system requirements
- [ ] Visual components are configured with appropriate default settings
- [ ] Prefab can be instantiated and works immediately without additional setup
- [ ] All component references and configurations are properly serialized

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create brick prefab with Brick MonoBehaviour and all required Unity components
- Configure Collider2D with proper physics layer assignment and collision detection settings
- Add SpriteRenderer with default brick visual configuration and material settings
- Include ParticleSystem and AudioSource components with proper default settings
- Set up prefab with appropriate default BrickData configuration for immediate deployment

**Technical Details:**
- Prefab location: `Assets/Prefabs/Gameplay/Brick.prefab`
- Components: Brick (script), SpriteRenderer, BoxCollider2D, ParticleSystem, AudioSource
- Physics layer: "Bricks" layer assignment for proper collision matrix integration
- Default BrickData: Normal brick type with 1 hit point, 10 score value, blue color
- Collider settings: IsTrigger=false, proper size matching sprite bounds
- Particle settings: Burst emission, color matching, appropriate particle count
- Audio settings: 3D spatial blend, proper volume, and priority configuration

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Prefab template pattern with complete component configuration
- **Performance:** Optimized prefab settings for efficient instantiation and runtime performance
- **Resilience:** Complete prefab configuration enabling immediate use without additional setup

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Prefabs/Gameplay/Brick.prefab` - Complete brick prefab with all components configured for deployment
