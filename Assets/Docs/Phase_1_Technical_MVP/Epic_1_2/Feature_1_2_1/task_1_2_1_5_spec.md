# **TASK 1.2.1.5: VISUAL EFFECTS SYSTEM** *(Medium - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.1.5 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Visual Effects, Particle Systems, Player Feedback |
| **Dependencies** | Destruction mechanics implementation working (Task 1.2.1.4) |
| **Deliverable** | Complete visual effects system for brick destruction |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Adds ParticleSystem components to brick GameObjects
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Particle effects positioned relative to brick GameObject transform
- **Components:** ParticleSystem component integrated with Brick MonoBehaviour
- **System Connections** | Triggered by destruction events, coordinates with existing feedback systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Particle effects trigger immediately on brick destruction
- [ ] Particle colors match destroyed brick colors for visual consistency
- [ ] Visual effects enhance destruction satisfaction without cluttering screen
- [ ] Particle system performs efficiently without frame rate impact
- [ ] Effect cleanup prevents particle system memory leaks

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Integrate Unity ParticleSystem component for destruction effects with dynamic color matching
- Add particle burst configuration based on brick type and color for visual variety
- Implement visual feedback timing synchronized perfectly with destruction events
- Add comprehensive particle effect cleanup and memory management
- Configure particle effects for satisfying arcade-style visual impact and feedback

**Technical Details:**
- Component integration: ParticleSystem component reference with burst emission configuration
- Color matching: ParticleSystem.main.startColor = brickData.brickColor for consistency
- Burst configuration: ParticleSystem.Emit(particleCount) triggered on destruction
- Effect timing: Immediate trigger on TriggerDestruction() call with proper synchronization
- Cleanup: ParticleSystem.Stop() and component cleanup on GameObject destruction
- Configuration: Particle count, lifetime, velocity, and emission settings per brick type

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Component-based particle effects with event-driven triggering
- **Performance:** Efficient particle emission with minimal draw calls and optimized settings
- **Resilience:** Robust particle cleanup with memory leak prevention and performance optimization

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - Extended with ParticleSystem integration and visual effects triggering
