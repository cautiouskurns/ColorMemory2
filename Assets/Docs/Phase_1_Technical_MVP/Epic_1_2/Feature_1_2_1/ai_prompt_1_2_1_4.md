# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Destruction Mechanics Implementation** *(55 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.2.1.4
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Destruction Logic, Memory Management, Event System
**Priority:** Critical

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Brick destruction mechanics with proper cleanup and event notification
**Game Context:** Breakout arcade game requiring reliable brick removal when hit points reach zero

**Purpose:** Implements the core destruction logic that removes bricks from the game when they reach zero hit points, ensuring proper memory cleanup and system notification for scoring and level progression tracking.
**Complexity:** Medium - GameObject lifecycle management with event system integration

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// Extend existing Brick MonoBehaviour class
public class Brick : MonoBehaviour
{
    // ... existing properties from previous tasks ...
    
    [Header("Destruction")]
    [SerializeField] private float destructionDelay = 0.1f;
    
    // Destruction events
    public static System.Action<Brick> OnBrickDestroyed;
    public System.Action<Brick> OnThisBrickDestroyed;
    
    // Destruction mechanics
    public void TriggerDestruction()
    {
        if (currentHitPoints <= 0 && !isDestroyed)
        {
            ProcessDestruction();
        }
    }
    
    private void ProcessDestruction() { }
    private void CleanupReferences() { }
    private void NotifyDestructionSystems() { }
    
    // Unity lifecycle
    private void OnDestroy() { }
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Destruction triggering when hit points reach zero with validation to prevent multiple calls
- GameObject destruction using Unity's Destroy() method with configurable delay
- Event system for notifying external systems (CollisionManager, future scoring) of destruction
- Comprehensive memory cleanup including event unsubscription and reference clearing
- Multiple destruction call protection with isDestroyed flag validation

### **Dependencies:**

- Collision detection integration from Task 1.2.1.3 (required)
- Existing brick state management and hit point system
- If collision detection missing: Create stub integration with manual destruction triggering
- Event subscribers (CollisionManager, future scoring systems) are optional

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient destruction with minimal frame impact during removal
- Proper memory management preventing leaks and dangling references
- Destruction events fire immediately before GameObject removal

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - destruction logic and cleanup only
- Keep destruction methods focused on removal and notification
- Only implement destruction mechanics explicitly required by specification
- Avoid adding visual/audio effects - save for future tasks

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Handles proper destruction and removal of brick GameObjects from scene
**Scene Hierarchy:** Manages cleanup of destroyed bricks from grid hierarchy
**Inspector Config:** Destruction delay configuration for timing control
**System Connections:** Communicates destruction events to CollisionManager and future scoring systems

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering destruction triggering, event system, GameObject removal, memory cleanup, and validation)
2. **Code Files** (Extended Brick.cs with destruction mechanics and event system)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (configures destruction settings and tests destruction mechanics)
4. **Integration Notes** (explanation of how destruction coordinates with collision system and external subscribers)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` (extend existing file)
**Code Standards:** Unity lifecycle best practices, event system conventions, comprehensive cleanup

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/1214CreateDestructionMechanicsSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Configure Brick Destruction"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateDestructionMechanicsSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Find existing Brick components and configure destruction parameters
- Set up destruction delay and validation settings
- Create test scenarios for destruction mechanics validation
- Configure event system subscribers for testing
- Validate destruction cleanup and memory management
- Test multiple destruction call protection

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate detailed console output showing destruction mechanics configuration
- List destruction event subscribers and notification system status
- Provide testing instructions for validating destruction logic and cleanup
- Include memory management verification and leak prevention measures

### **Documentation:**

- Create brief .md file capturing:
  - Destruction triggering logic and validation system
  - Event system architecture for destruction notifications
  - Memory cleanup procedures and reference management
  - Multiple destruction call protection and edge case handling

### **Custom Instructions:**

- Add comprehensive destruction validation with detailed logging
- Include destruction event debugging tools for development
- Create destruction testing utilities for validation and QA

## **7. SUCCESS CRITERIA** *(When You're Done)*

### **Core Functionality:**

- [ ] Brick destruction triggers reliably when hit points reach zero
- [ ] GameObject is properly removed from scene and memory
- [ ] Destruction events are fired for external system coordination
- [ ] Multiple destruction calls are handled gracefully without errors
- [ ] Memory cleanup prevents leaks and dangling references

### **Integration Tests:**

- [ ] Destruction triggers correctly when currentHitPoints reaches zero
- [ ] Destruction events notify all registered subscribers
- [ ] GameObject removal completes without errors or memory leaks
- [ ] Multiple destruction attempts are handled safely

### **Quality Gates:**

- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Follows Unity GameObject lifecycle best practices
- [ ] Event system is robust and handles subscriber failures gracefully
- [ ] Memory management prevents leaks and maintains performance

## **8. RESILIENCE FLAGS** *(Implementation Modifiers)*

**StubMissingDeps:** Basic - create minimal event system if external subscribers missing
**ValidationLevel:** Strict - validate all destruction states and cleanup procedures
**Reusability:** Reusable - destruction system should work with different brick configurations

## **CONSTRAINTS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Unity Best Practices:**

- Use Destroy(gameObject, delay) for controlled destruction timing
- Implement proper OnDestroy() cleanup for component references
- Use static events for global destruction notifications
- Cache destruction state to prevent multiple destruction calls
- Handle event subscription/unsubscription properly to prevent memory leaks

### **Performance Requirements:**

- Destruction processing completes within single frame
- No memory allocation during destruction sequence
- Event notification system handles multiple subscribers efficiently

### **Architecture Pattern:**

- Observer pattern for destruction event notification with cleanup validation and memory management

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**

- **If collision detection not integrated:** Create manual destruction triggering method with clear usage instructions
- **If hit point system missing:** Create basic hit point validation with default values
- **If event subscribers missing:** Log warnings but continue destruction process

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Complete destruction even if event notification fails
- Log detailed warnings for cleanup failures with recovery instructions
- Ensure GameObject removal succeeds even with partial cleanup failures
