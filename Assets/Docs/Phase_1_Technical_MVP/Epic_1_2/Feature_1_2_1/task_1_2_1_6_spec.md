# **TASK 1.2.1.6: AUDIO EFFECTS INTEGRATION** *(Low - 35 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.2.1.6 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Audio, Sound Effects, Player Feedback |
| **Dependencies** | Destruction mechanics implementation working (Task 1.2.1.4) |
| **Deliverable** | Complete audio feedback system for brick destruction |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Adds AudioSource components to brick GameObjects for sound playback
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Audio components integrated into existing brick GameObject structure
- **Components:** AudioSource component integrated with Brick MonoBehaviour for sound effects
- **System Connections:** Triggered by destruction events, coordinates with visual effects system

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Audio effects trigger immediately on brick destruction
- [ ] Different brick types play distinct sound effects
- [ ] Audio timing is synchronized with destruction and visual effects
- [ ] Sound effects enhance destruction satisfaction with appropriate arcade feel
- [ ] Audio system performs efficiently without audio dropouts or delays

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Integrate AudioSource component for destruction sound effects with proper configuration
- Add audio clip configuration system for different brick types with distinct sounds
- Implement audio triggering synchronized perfectly with destruction events
- Add audio effect variation and pitch randomization for enhanced variety and engagement
- Configure audio settings for satisfying arcade-style sound feedback and atmosphere

**Technical Details:**
- Component integration: AudioSource component reference with PlayOneShot() usage
- Audio clip assignment: Dictionary<BrickType, AudioClip> for type-specific sound effects
- Triggering: AudioSource.PlayOneShot(audioClip) on TriggerDestruction() call
- Pitch variation: Random.Range(0.8f, 1.2f) for audio variety and natural feel
- Configuration: Volume levels, spatial blend, and priority settings for arcade experience
- Synchronization: Audio triggers simultaneously with visual effects and destruction

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Component-based audio system with event-driven sound triggering
- **Performance:** Efficient audio playback with minimal processing overhead and memory usage
- **Resilience:** Robust audio handling with graceful degradation if audio clips missing

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Brick.cs` - Extended with AudioSource integration and sound effect triggering
