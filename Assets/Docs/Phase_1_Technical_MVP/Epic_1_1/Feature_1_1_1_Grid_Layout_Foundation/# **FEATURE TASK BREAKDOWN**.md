# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.1.1: GRID LAYOUT FOUNDATION** *(Total Duration: 12 hours)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Creates the structured 2x2 grid layout that organizes the four color squares in the center of the screen, establishing the visual foundation for all player interactions.
**Complexity:** Medium
**Main Deliverables:** GameGrid GameObject with Grid Layout Group configured for 2x2 layout, Canvas and UI hierarchy properly structured in scene, responsive positioning system that centers grid on various screen sizes

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Tasks are divided by Unity system responsibilities - scene structure, GameObject hierarchy, component configuration, and responsive behavior. This allows each task to focus on a specific Unity subsystem while building incrementally toward the complete grid foundation.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Canvas must exist before GameGrid can be created as a child, Grid Layout Group requires the GameObject to be configured first, and responsive positioning needs the complete grid structure to calculate proper centering.

#### **TASK 1.1.1.2: GameGrid GameObject Creation** *(Duration: 30 minutes)*

| Task Details | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Creates the GameGrid GameObject that will contain the four color squares and organize them spatially |
| **Scope** | GameObject creation, proper parent-child hierarchy setup, basic RectTransform configuration |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Dependencies** | Canvas hierarchy from Task 1.1.1.1 must be complete |
| **Primary Deliverable** | GameGrid GameObject properly positioned as child of Canvas with correct RectTransform setup |

**Core Implementation Focus:**
GameGrid GameObject with RectTransform component configured for center positioning within the Canvas, establishing the container that will house the four ColorSquare objects.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- GameGrid as direct child of Canvas GameObject
- RectTransform anchored to center of Canvas
- Proper naming convention matching TDS scene hierarchy
- Initial size configuration suitable for 2x2 grid of color squares

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] GameGrid GameObject exists as child of Canvas
- [ ] RectTransform properly configured for center positioning
- [ ] GameObject follows TDS naming conventions
- [ ] Parent-child hierarchy correctly established

#### **TASK 1.1.1.3: Grid Layout Group Configuration** *(Duration: 45 minutes)*

| Task Details | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Configures Grid Layout Group component on GameGrid to automatically arrange child objects in 2x2 pattern |
| **Scope** | Grid Layout Group component addition and configuration, cell size and spacing calculations, constraint settings |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Dependencies** | GameGrid GameObject from Task 1.1.1.2 must exist |
| **Primary Deliverable** | Fully configured Grid Layout Group that will automatically arrange 4 child objects in 2x2 grid |

**Core Implementation Focus:**
Grid Layout Group component with proper cell size, spacing, and constraint configuration to create exactly 2 columns and 2 rows for the four color squares.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- Grid Layout Group component attached to GameGrid GameObject
- Cell size configured for appropriate square dimensions (target: equal width/height)
- Spacing configured for visual separation between squares
- Constraint set to Fixed Column Count with value of 2
- Start corner and start axis configured for proper arrangement

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Grid Layout Group component properly attached and configured
- [ ] 2x2 arrangement enforced through Fixed Column Count constraint
- [ ] Cell size appropriate for color square display
- [ ] Spacing provides clear visual separation between grid positions

#### **TASK 1.1.1.4: Responsive Positioning System** *(Duration: 60 minutes)*

| Task Details | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Implements responsive positioning that centers the grid appropriately across different WebGL canvas sizes |
| **Scope** | RectTransform anchor and positioning refinement, responsive scaling considerations, WebGL viewport handling |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Dependencies** | Complete GameGrid with Grid Layout Group from Task 1.1.1.3 |
| **Primary Deliverable** | Responsive positioning system that maintains grid centering across different screen sizes |

**Core Implementation Focus:**
RectTransform configuration with proper anchoring and Canvas Scaler integration to ensure the GameGrid remains centered and appropriately sized across different WebGL viewport dimensions.

**Key Technical Requirements:**
- RectTransform anchors configured for center positioning
- Integration with Canvas Scaler for consistent sizing across resolutions
- Proper handling of different aspect ratios for WebGL deployment
- Margin/padding considerations for different screen sizes
- Testing approach for validating responsive behavior

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Grid remains centered across different canvas sizes
- [ ] Grid maintains consistent proportions when scaling
- [ ] Responsive behavior validated for common WebGL viewport sizes
- [ ] No clipping or overflow issues on smaller screens

### **TASK DEPENDENCY CHAIN**

```
Task 1.1.1.1 → Task 1.1.1.2 → Task 1.1.1.3 → Task 1.1.1.4
↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Canvas Setup   GameGrid       Grid Layout    Responsive
              GameObject      Group Config   Positioning
```

**Critical Dependencies:**
- **Task 1.1.1.2** requires Task 1.1.1.1 because: GameGrid must be created as child of Canvas hierarchy
- **Task 1.1.1.3** requires Task 1.1.1.2 because: Grid Layout Group component must be attached to existing GameGrid GameObject
- **Task 1.1.1.4** requires Task 1.1.1.3 because: Responsive positioning calculations need complete grid configuration to determine proper centering

### **INTEGRATION POINTS**

**Feature Integration:** These tasks combine to create a complete grid foundation where Canvas provides the UI rendering context, GameGrid provides the spatial container, Grid Layout Group enforces 2x2 arrangement, and responsive positioning ensures proper display across devices.

**System Integration:** This grid foundation will serve as the parent container for ColorSquare GameObjects created in Feature 1.1.2, and the responsive system will work with the overall UI framework established for score display and other UI elements in later features.
