**EPIC 1.1: CORE GRID SYSTEM** *(5 days)*

## **Epic Overview**

**Priority:** Critical  
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Purpose:** Establishes the fundamental interactive foundation of the game by creating a responsive 2x2 grid of clickable color squares that players can interact with. This epic validates the core input mechanism and visual presentation that all subsequent gameplay depends on.

**Dependencies:** New Unity scene creation, basic project setup

**Playable State After Epic:** Player can see 4 distinct colored squares arranged in a 2x2 grid and click on each square to receive immediate visual feedback, confirming the core interaction model works.

## **Feature Breakdown**

| Feature | Duration | Prerequisites | Core Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **1.1.1: Grid Layout Foundation** | 12 hours | Scene setup | Creates organized 2x2 visual structure |
| **1.1.2: ColorSquare Component System** | 20 hours | Grid layout complete | Builds individual clickable color squares |
| **1.1.3: Click Detection Integration** | 8 hours | ColorSquare components ready | Enables player interaction with visual feedback |

## **FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS**

### **FEATURE 1.1.1: GRID LAYOUT FOUNDATION** *(12 hours)*

**Purpose:** Creates the structured 2x2 grid layout that organizes the four color squares in the center of the screen, establishing the visual foundation for all player interactions.

**Technical Approach:** Unity Canvas system with Grid Layout Group component for automatic 2x2 arrangement, responsive design considerations for different screen sizes.

**Core Deliverables:**
* GameGrid GameObject with Grid Layout Group configured for 2x2 layout
* Canvas and UI hierarchy properly structured in scene
* Responsive positioning system that centers grid on various screen sizes

**Success Criteria:**
* [ ] 2x2 grid structure visible and properly centered on screen
* [ ] Grid maintains consistent spacing and proportions
* [ ] Layout responds appropriately to different WebGL canvas sizes

### **FEATURE 1.1.2: COLORSCHEME COMPONENT SYSTEM** *(20 hours)*

**Purpose:** Develops the ColorSquare MonoBehaviour component that represents individual clickable squares, implementing the core visual identity and interaction foundation for each color.

**Technical Approach:** Unity Button component integration with custom ColorSquare script, Image components for visual representation, color configuration system using ColorIndex enum.

**Core Deliverables:**
* ColorSquare MonoBehaviour script with color configuration
* Four ColorSquare GameObjects (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) with proper color assignments
* Visual feedback system for hover and click states

**Success Criteria:**
* [ ] Each square displays correct color from specified palette (#FF4444, #4444FF, #44FF44, #FFFF44)
* [ ] Squares provide visual feedback when hovered and clicked
* [ ] ColorIndex enum properly maps to visual square representations

### **FEATURE 1.1.3: CLICK DETECTION INTEGRATION** *(8 hours)*

**Purpose:** Connects player mouse clicks to ColorSquare components, enabling the grid to detect and respond to player input with immediate feedback confirmation.

**Technical Approach:** Unity Button OnClick event system integration, click event propagation to ColorSquare components, basic visual feedback triggers.

**Core Deliverables:**
* Click event handling system integrated with ColorSquare components
* Visual click feedback (brief highlight or scale effect)
* Console logging system for validating click detection during development

**Success Criteria:**
* [ ] Each color square responds to mouse clicks within <100ms
* [ ] Click events properly identify which ColorSquare was activated
* [ ] Visual click feedback provides clear confirmation to player

## **Epic Integration**

**System Architecture:** The Grid System creates a structured container (GameGrid) that houses four independent ColorSquare components, each capable of detecting and responding to player input while maintaining visual consistency through the Grid Layout Group.

**Dependencies on Other Epics:** Requires basic project setup and scene structure. Will integrate with Sequence Engine for sequence display and State Machine Foundation for input validation.

**Provides to Other Epics:** Delivers the core interactive elements that Sequence Engine will control for showing sequences and InputValidator will monitor for player responses. Establishes the fundamental ColorIndex-to-visual-square mapping system.
