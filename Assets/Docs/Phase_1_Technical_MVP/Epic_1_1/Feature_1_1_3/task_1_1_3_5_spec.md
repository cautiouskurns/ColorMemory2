# **TASK 1.1.3.5: EDGE CASE HANDLING AND VALIDATION** *(Medium - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.1.3.5 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Validation, Edge Cases, Robustness, Debug |
| **Dependencies** | Complete collision response system with feedback working |
| **Deliverable** | Robust collision system handling all edge cases gracefully |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Extends Ball GameObject with validation and correction systems
- **Scene Hierarchy:** No hierarchy changes - adds validation logic to existing systems
- **Components:** Utilizes existing Rigidbody2D and Collider2D for position/velocity validation
- **System Connections** | Integrates with CollisionManager and BallController for anomaly detection and correction

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Ball never gets permanently stuck in collision scenarios
- [ ] High-speed collisions don't cause tunneling or missed detections
- [ ] Simultaneous collisions are resolved predictably and fairly
- [ ] System automatically corrects physics anomalies without breaking gameplay
- [ ] Collision debugging tools provide clear information for development

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Detect and automatically correct ball stuck scenarios with position validation
- Prevent ball tunneling through objects using continuous collision detection validation
- Handle simultaneous collisions with multiple objects using priority resolution
- Continuously validate ball speed and position constraints during gameplay
- Implement comprehensive collision debugging tools for development testing

**Technical Details:**
- Stuck Detection: Monitor ball velocity magnitude < 0.1f for > 2 seconds, apply correction force
- Tunneling Prevention: Validate collision.contacts array for missed detections, use Rigidbody2D.MovePosition()
- Simultaneous Collision Handling: Process collisions by distance priority, apply strongest collision response
- Speed Validation: Clamp ball speed between minSpeed (3.0f) and maxSpeed (15.0f) continuously
- Debug Tools: OnDrawGizmos() for collision visualization, collision event logging with timestamps

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Validator pattern with automatic correction mechanisms
- **Performance:** Validation checks run every FixedUpdate() with minimal computational overhead
- **Resilience:** Self-healing system that maintains gameplay flow under all edge case scenarios

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Managers/CollisionManager.cs` - Extend with ValidateCollisionIntegrity() methods
- `Assets/Scripts/Debug/CollisionDebugger.cs` - New debugging utility class for development validation
