# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.1.3: COLLISION RESPONSE INTEGRATION** *(Total Duration: 28 hours)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Integrates ball and paddle physics systems with sophisticated collision response that creates satisfying bounce behavior and proper physics feedback for arcade-quality gameplay.
**Complexity:** High - requires coordinating multiple physics systems with precise timing and response behavior
**Main Deliverables:** CollisionManager system, bounce angle calculations, physics layer configuration, collision feedback system, edge case handling

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Divided by system responsibility - starting with foundational physics layer setup, then building the core collision management system, adding sophisticated bounce calculations, integrating feedback systems, and finally hardening with edge case handling.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Physics layers must be configured first to enable proper collision isolation, CollisionManager provides the foundation for all collision logic, bounce calculations require the manager framework, feedback systems need working collisions to respond to, and edge case handling validates the complete system.
