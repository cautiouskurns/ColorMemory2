# **TASK 1.1.3.4: COLLISION FEEDBACK INTEGRATION** *(Low - 40 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.1.3.4 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Low |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Audio, Visual, Feedback, Polish |
| **Dependencies** | Working bounce angle calculations and collision detection |
| **Deliverable** | Comprehensive collision feedback system with audio-visual responses |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Extend CollisionManager with AudioSource and ParticleSystem references
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Add audio and particle effect components to existing structure
- **Components:** AudioSource for sound effects, ParticleSystem for visual impact effects
- **System Connections:** Triggered by CollisionManager collision events, coordinates with audio and visual systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] All collision types trigger appropriate audio and visual feedback
- [ ] Feedback timing is immediate and synchronized with physics events
- [ ] Audio cues are distinct and recognizable for each collision type
- [ ] Visual effects enhance collision impact without cluttering screen
- [ ] Feedback system performs efficiently without frame rate impact

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Trigger distinct audio cues for paddle bounces, wall bounces, and brick hits
- Add visual feedback including screen shake, particle bursts, and color flashes
- Ensure feedback timing matches collision events with no delay
- Scale feedback intensity based on collision force or ball speed
- Integrate seamlessly with Unity AudioSource and ParticleSystem components

**Technical Details:**
- Audio Integration: AudioSource.PlayOneShot() for collision sound effects
- Particle Effects: ParticleSystem.Emit() for collision impact bursts
- Screen Shake: Camera position offset with Mathf.Sin() dampening over time
- Collision Force: collision.relativeVelocity.magnitude for feedback intensity scaling
- Effect Duration: 0.1-0.3 second feedback effects with proper cleanup

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern - CollisionManager triggers feedback responses
- **Performance** | Efficient one-shot audio and particle effects with minimal overhead
- **Resilience:** Feedback failures don't impact core gameplay - graceful degradation

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Managers/CollisionManager.cs` - Extend with TriggerCollisionFeedback() method
- Integration with existing AudioSource and ParticleSystem components in scene
