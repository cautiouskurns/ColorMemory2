### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.1.1.2 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Physics, GameObject, Setup |
| **Dependencies** | BallData structure from Task 1.1.1.1 |
| **Deliverable** | Configured Ball GameObject with physics components ready for controller integration |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Ball GameObject with proper physics components and collision configuration
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Ball positioned in GameArea according to TDS scene structure
- **Components:** Rigidbody2D, CircleCollider2D, Physics Material 2D, and visual representation
- **System Connections:** Foundation for BallController integration and physics debugging tools

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Ball GameObject has properly configured Rigidbody2D with continuous collision detection
- [ ] CircleCollider2D provides accurate collision boundaries for ball
- [ ] Physics material enables consistent, arcade-appropriate bouncing behavior
- [ ] Collision layers correctly isolate ball interactions as specified in TDS
- [ ] Visual representation matches GDD specifications (white ball with trail capability)
- [ ] GameObject properly integrates with BallData structure from Task 1.1.1.1

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create Ball GameObject with Rigidbody2D configured for continuous collision detection
- Configure CircleCollider2D with appropriate radius for game scale and visual representation
- Set up Physics Material 2D for arcade-style bouncing behavior
- Implement collision layer assignment matching TDS collision layer specifications
- Establish visual representation supporting ball trail effects
- Integrate BallData structure for physics property configuration

**Technical Details:**
- GameObject name: "Ball" (matching TDS scene hierarchy)
- Rigidbody2D: Continuous collision detection, freeze Z rotation, appropriate mass
- CircleCollider2D: Radius matching visual scale, trigger disabled for physics collisions
- Physics Material: High bounciness (0.8-1.0), low friction (0.0-0.2) for arcade feel
- Collision Layer: "Ball" layer interacting with Paddle, Bricks, Boundaries per TDS
- Visual: Sprite renderer with white circle, material supporting trail effect integration

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Unity GameObject component composition pattern with physics integration
- **Performance:** Optimized physics components targeting 60fps WebGL performance
- **Resilience:** Robust collision detection preventing tunneling at high speeds
