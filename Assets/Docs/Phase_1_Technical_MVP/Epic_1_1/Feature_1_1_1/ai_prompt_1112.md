# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Ball GameObject Configuration** *(60 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.1.1.2
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Physics, GameObject, Setup
**Priority:** Critical

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** Ball GameObject with complete physics component configuration and asset creation
**Game Context:** Breakout - Arcade action game requiring precisely configured ball physics with reliable collision detection

**Purpose:** Creates the physical Ball GameObject with properly configured Unity physics components (Rigidbody2D, CircleCollider2D, Physics Material 2D) and visual representation. This establishes the foundation for BallController integration and ensures reliable collision detection at high speeds.
**Complexity:** Medium complexity GameObject setup with physics components and asset creation, 60-minute implementation

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
// No custom classes required - this task focuses on GameObject and component configuration
// Editor Setup Script handles GameObject creation, component attachment, and asset creation
// Integration with existing BallData structure from Task 1.1.1.1
```

### **Core Logic:**

GameObject component composition pattern with Unity physics integration:
- Ball GameObject creation with proper naming and hierarchy placement
- Rigidbody2D configuration with continuous collision detection for high-speed physics
- CircleCollider2D setup with appropriate radius for game scale and collision accuracy
- Physics Material 2D creation and configuration for arcade-style bouncing behavior
- Collision layer assignment following TDS specifications for proper interaction filtering
- Visual representation setup with SpriteRenderer and white circle sprite

### **Dependencies:**

- BallData structure from Task 1.1.1.1 (required for physics configuration integration)
- Unity Physics2D system for Rigidbody2D and collision components
- Unity Sprite system for visual representation
- GameArea GameObject (parent container from TDS scene hierarchy)

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Rigidbody2D configured for continuous collision detection to prevent tunneling at high speeds
- Optimized physics components targeting 60fps WebGL performance
- Minimal memory overhead for physics calculations and collision detection

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Unity GameObject component composition pattern with physics integration
- Configure components for optimal arcade-style physics rather than realistic simulation
- Only implement components explicitly required by ball physics system specifications
- Ensure robust collision detection preventing physics anomalies at varying ball speeds

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Ball GameObject with Rigidbody2D, CircleCollider2D, SpriteRenderer, and Physics Material 2D components configured
**Scene Hierarchy:** Ball positioned in GameArea according to TDS scene structure (GameArea/Ball)
**Inspector Config:** Physics components configured with arcade-appropriate values, collision layers properly assigned
**System Connections:** Foundation for BallController integration and physics debugging tools

using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateBallGameObjectSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Ball GameObject")]
    public static void CreateBallGameObject()
    {
