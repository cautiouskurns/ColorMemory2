# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.1.1: BALL PHYSICS SYSTEM** *(Total Duration: 32 hours)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Creates the core ball physics that drive all gameplay interactions, ensuring consistent and satisfying movement with reliable collision detection at varying speeds.
**Complexity:** High
**Main Deliverables:** BallController MonoBehaviour with physics integration, Ball GameObject with proper physics components, velocity management system, launch mechanics, and physics debugging tools.

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Tasks are divided by logical system layers - data structures first, then GameObject setup, core physics logic, advanced physics features, and finally debugging tools. This allows incremental building where each task adds a functional layer to the ball physics system.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Data structures must exist before classes that use them, GameObject setup must precede controller attachment, basic physics must work before advanced features like launch mechanics, and debugging tools require complete system to validate against.
