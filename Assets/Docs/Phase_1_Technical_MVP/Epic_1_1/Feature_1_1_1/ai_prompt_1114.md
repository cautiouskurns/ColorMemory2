# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Velocity Management System** *(75 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.1.1.4
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Physics, Velocity, Arcade Mechanics
**Priority:** Critical

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** BallController velocity management enhancement
**Game Context:** Breakout arcade game requiring consistent ball physics behavior for optimal gameplay feel

**Purpose:** Ensure ball maintains consistent speed throughout gameplay with arcade-style physics feel, overriding Unity's realistic physics acceleration/deceleration to create responsive, predictable ball movement
**Complexity:** Medium complexity physics override system requiring frame-rate independent implementation (75 minute implementation)

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
public class BallController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Velocity Management")]
    [SerializeField] private float targetSpeed = 10f;
    [SerializeField] private float minSpeed = 5f;
    [SerializeField] private float maxSpeed = 20f;
    [SerializeField] private bool enableVelocityNormalization = true;
    
    private Rigidbody2D rb;
    private Vector2 lastValidVelocity;
    
    // Core velocity management methods
    private void FixedUpdate() // For frame-rate independence
    private void NormalizeVelocity() // Core normalization algorithm
    private void EnforceSpeedConstraints() // Min/max speed enforcement
    private void HandleEdgeCases() // Zero velocity and stuck ball detection
    private bool IsValidVelocity(Vector2 velocity) // Validation helper
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- **Velocity Normalization Algorithm:** FixedUpdate() method continuously normalizes rigidbody.velocity to maintain targetSpeed using Vector2.normalized * targetSpeed pattern
- **Speed Constraint System:** Min/max speed enforcement preventing physics-induced acceleration/deceleration through speed clamping
- **Edge Case Handling:** Zero velocity detection with lastValidVelocity backup, stuck ball recovery using position validation
- **Frame Independence:** FixedUpdate() usage ensuring consistent physics timestep regardless of framerate fluctuations
- **Performance Optimization:** Cached Vector2 calculations, minimal allocations during gameplay, optimized magnitude checks

### **Dependencies:**

- **BallController foundation:** Requires existing BallController from Task 1.1.1.3 with Rigidbody2D component
- **BallData configuration:** Integration with speed limits and normalization parameters (create stub if missing)
- **Unity Physics:** Rigidbody2D component with continuous collision detection enabled

### **Performance Constraints:**

- **60fps WebGL target:** Velocity calculations must not impact frame rate
- **Minimal GC pressure:** Avoid Vector2 allocations in FixedUpdate(), cache calculations
- **Response time:** <50ms from velocity change to normalization
- **Memory usage:** <1KB additional memory footprint for velocity management

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - velocity management focused solely on speed consistency
- Keep velocity management methods focused and appropriately sized
- Only implement velocity normalization and speed constraint functionality as specified
- Avoid feature creep - don't add trajectory prediction or advanced physics features not in requirements

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Enhance existing Ball GameObject with velocity management functionality integrated into BallController component
**Scene Hierarchy:** No additional GameObjects required - enhancement to existing Ball under GameArea/Ball
**Inspector Config:** Velocity management parameters exposed with [Header("Velocity Management")] organization, default values for targetSpeed, minSpeed, maxSpeed, and enableVelocityNormalization toggle
**System Connections:** Integration with launch mechanics for initial velocity setting, collision response for bounce handling, and physics debugging for velocity monitoring

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering approach and key steps)
2. **Code Files** (all files in dependency order)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (always required - creates GameObjects and scene setup)
4. **Integration Notes** (brief explanation of how this integrates with other systems)

**File Structure:** `Assets/Scripts/Ball/BallController.cs` - Enhanced with velocity management methods and FixedUpdate integration
**Code Standards:** Unity C# naming conventions, [Header] attributes for Inspector organization, XML documentation for public methods

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/1114CreateVelocityManagementSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Velocity Management"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateVelocityManagementSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Validate existing Ball GameObject with BallController component exists
- Add velocity management functionality to existing BallController
- Configure velocity management settings per technical specifications
- Assign default values for targetSpeed (10f), minSpeed (5f), maxSpeed (20f)
- Enable velocity normalization by default
- Handle missing Ball GameObject gracefully with clear error messages
- Prevent duplicate setup with validation MenuItem
- Call prerequisite BallController setup if missing

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateVelocityManagementSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Velocity Management")]
    public static void CreateVelocityManagement()
    {
        // Validation and prerequisite calls
        // Ball GameObject validation and enhancement
        // Velocity management configuration
        // Component settings verification
        Debug.Log("âœ… Velocity Management created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Velocity Management", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateVelocityManagement()
    {
        // Return false if velocity management already configured
        return [validation logic];
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log clear success/failure messages with specific velocity management details
