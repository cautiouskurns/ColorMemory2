- **Scene Hierarchy:** Velocity management integrated into existing BallController
- **Components:** Enhanced BallController with velocity normalization and speed constraints
- **System Connections:** Integration with launch mechanics, collision response, and physics debugging

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Ball maintains consistent speed throughout gameplay without acceleration/deceleration
- [ ] Speed constraints prevent ball from becoming too slow or too fast
- [ ] Velocity management performs efficiently at 60fps without performance impact
- [ ] Arcade physics feel is maintained despite Unity's realistic physics simulation
- [ ] Velocity normalization algorithm handles edge cases (zero velocity, extreme speeds)
- [ ] Frame-rate independence ensures consistent behavior across different performance levels

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement velocity normalization algorithm maintaining constant ball speed
- Enforce speed constraint system preventing physics-induced acceleration/deceleration
- Create frame-rate independent velocity management for consistent WebGL performance
- Override realistic physics behavior with arcade-style movement characteristics
- Handle edge cases like zero velocity, stuck ball scenarios, and extreme speed situations
- Integrate with BallData configuration for speed limits and normalization parameters

**Technical Details:**
- Velocity normalization: FixedUpdate() method normalizing rigidbody.velocity to target speed
- Speed constraints: Min/max speed enforcement using BallData configuration values
- Normalization algorithm: Vector2.normalized * targetSpeed with null vector handling
- Frame independence: FixedUpdate() usage ensuring consistent physics timestep
- Performance optimization: Minimal Vector2 allocations, cached calculations
- Edge case handling: Zero velocity detection, stuck ball recovery, speed clamping

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Physics override system maintaining arcade-style behavior within Unity's realistic physics
- **Performance:** Optimized velocity calculations targeting 60fps WebGL with minimal GC pressure
- **Resilience:** Robust edge case handling preventing physics anomalies and stuck states
