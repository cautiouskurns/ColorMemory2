# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.1.2: PADDLE CONTROL SYSTEM** *(Total Duration: 7 hours AI implementation)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Implements responsive paddle movement that feels precise and immediate, supporting multiple input methods while maintaining proper game boundaries for arcade-quality Breakout gameplay.
**Complexity:** Medium-High (multi-input system with performance constraints)
**Main Deliverables:** PaddleController MonoBehaviour with multi-input support, Paddle GameObject with physics integration, boundary constraint system, and movement optimization achieving <50ms response time.

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Tasks are divided following the established pattern: data structures first, GameObject setup, core controller logic, input system implementation, boundary constraints, and finally performance optimization. This allows incremental building where each task adds functional capability while maintaining clear dependencies.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Data structures must exist before controllers that use them, GameObject setup must precede controller attachment, basic movement must work before advanced input features, boundary constraints require established movement system, and performance optimization requires complete functionality to measure and improve.
