### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Final optimization of existing Paddle GameObject system
- **Scene Hierarchy:** No changes - optimization of existing system
- **Components:** Performance-optimized PaddleController with smooth movement interpolation
- **System Connections** Integration with 60fps WebGL performance requirements and response time validation

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Paddle movement feels smooth and predictable with proper acceleration/deceleration
- [ ] Movement system maintains 60fps performance on WebGL builds
- [ ] Input response time consistently meets <50ms requirement
- [ ] Movement interpolation eliminates jerky or stuttering motion
- [ ] Performance optimization avoids garbage collection pressure during gameplay

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement smooth movement interpolation using Lerp or similar techniques for natural paddle motion
- Apply acceleration/deceleration curves that feel responsive yet controllable
- Optimize performance ensuring 60fps WebGL target with multiple input polling
- Validate response time confirming <50ms input-to-movement latency requirement

**Technical Details:**
- Movement smoothing: Vector3.Lerp() or Mathf.SmoothDamp() for interpolated position updates
- Acceleration curves: Configurable ease-in/ease-out curves for natural movement feel
- Performance optimization: Cached component references, optimized Update() logic, minimal allocations
- Response time validation: Debug timing measurements confirming <50ms latency
- Memory optimization: Object pooling considerations, avoiding per-frame allocations
- WebGL optimization: Profile-guided optimization for browser deployment target

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Performance-optimized movement system with interpolation and curve-based acceleration
- **Performance:** Validated 60fps WebGL performance with <50ms response time guarantee  
- **Resilience:** Memory-efficient implementation avoiding garbage collection pressure during gameplay
