# **TASK 1.1.2.5: Boundary Constraint System** *(Medium - 60 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.1.2.5 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Boundaries, Constraints, Gameplay, Physics |
| **Dependencies** | Multi-input system from Task 1.1.2.4 |
| **Deliverable** | Boundary constraint system ensuring paddle remains within playfield boundaries |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Works with existing Paddle GameObject and GameArea container
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Integrates with GameArea boundaries and constraint detection
- **Components:** Extends PaddleController with boundary detection and position clamping
- **System Connections:** GameArea container bounds, boundary wall GameObjects, constraint enforcement

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Paddle cannot move beyond left boundary of playfield
- [ ] Paddle cannot move beyond right boundary of playfield
- [ ] Boundary constraints work with both keyboard and mouse input
- [ ] Constraint enforcement maintains smooth movement feel
- [ ] Edge cases (rapid movement, position corrections) handled gracefully

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement playfield boundary detection using GameArea container or configured world bounds
- Create position clamping logic maintaining paddle within valid X-coordinate range
- Ensure constraint enforcement works with both keyboard and mouse input methods
- Handle edge cases for high-speed movement and position corrections

**Technical Details:**
- Boundary detection: Use GameArea bounds or manually configured min/max X positions
- Position clamping: Mathf.Clamp() on paddle X position after movement calculation
- Integration with existing movement system without breaking input responsiveness
- Boundary limits: Account for paddle width (half-width offset from center position)
- Edge case handling: Validate position constraints before and after movement updates

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Constraint enforcement with position validation and clamping logic
- **Performance** Minimal overhead constraint checking integrated into movement updates
- **Resilience:** Robust edge case handling for unusual movement scenarios and rapid input

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Paddle/PaddleController.cs` - Enhanced with boundary constraint enforcement and position validation system
