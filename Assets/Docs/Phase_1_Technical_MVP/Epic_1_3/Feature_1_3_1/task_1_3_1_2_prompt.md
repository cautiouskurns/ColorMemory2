# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Physical Boundary Wall Creation** *(45 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.3.1.2
**Category:** System
**Tags:** GameObjects, Colliders, Boundaries, Positioning
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour with collider setup and positioning system
**Game Context:** Breakout game requiring invisible collision walls around 16:10 aspect ratio playfield perimeter

**Purpose:** Creates the actual invisible wall GameObjects with Collider2D components positioned around playfield perimeter, using configuration data for consistent boundary setup and collision detection.
**Complexity:** Medium - requires GameObject creation, collider configuration, and precise positioning system

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class BoundaryWall : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Wall Configuration")]
    public BoundaryType wallType;
    public BoundaryConfig config;
    
    [Header("Components")]
    private Collider2D wallCollider;
    
    // Wall creation and positioning methods
    // Collider setup and configuration
    // Camera bounds integration for positioning
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour creates invisible GameObjects with Collider2D components
- Wall creation methods for each boundary type (top, left, right) with proper dimensions
- Positioning system calculates correct placement based on camera bounds and configuration
- GameObject organization with proper naming and hierarchy structure for debugging

### **Dependencies:**

- BoundaryConfig data structures from Task 1.3.1.1 (required)
- Unity Physics2D system for Collider2D functionality
- Camera system for bounds calculation
- **Fallback Strategy:** Create basic colliders with default dimensions if BoundaryConfig missing

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient GameObject creation with minimal overhead
- Static colliders for optimal physics performance
- No runtime position updates during gameplay

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - each BoundaryWall handles one wall type
- Keep wall creation focused on GameObject setup without physics materials
- Only implement collider setup and positioning logic
- Use Component pattern for Unity MonoBehaviour integration

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** Creates invisible wall GameObjects with Collider2D components around playfield perimeter
**Scene Hierarchy:** Boundary walls organized under "Boundary System" parent container for clean hierarchy management
**Inspector Config:** BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour with [Header] attributes for wall type and configuration
**System Connections:** Uses BoundaryConfig data for positioning and dimensions, provides collision surfaces

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering approach and key steps)
2. **Code Files** (all files in dependency order)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (always required - creates GameObjects and scene setup)
4. **Integration Notes** (brief explanation of how this integrates with other systems)

**File Structure:** 
- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryWall.cs` - Main boundary wall MonoBehaviour
- Dependencies on BoundaryConfig from Task 1.3.1.1

**Code Standards:** Unity C# naming conventions, XML documentation for public methods, [Header] attributes for Inspector organization

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

**File Location:** `Assets/Editor/Setup/1312CreateBoundaryWallsSetup.cs`

**Menu Structure:** `"Breakout/Setup/Create Boundary Walls"`

**Class Pattern:** `CreateBoundaryWallsSetup` (static class)

**Core Functionality:**

- Create "Boundary System" parent GameObject for organization
- Create individual wall GameObjects for top, left, and right boundaries
- Add BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour components to each wall GameObject
- Configure Collider2D components with appropriate sizes and positions
- Assign BoundaryConfig reference to each wall component
- Position walls correctly based on camera bounds and 16:10 aspect ratio
- Set up proper GameObject names and tags for identification

**Template Structure:**

```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;

public static class CreateBoundaryWallsSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Boundary Walls")]
    public static void CreateBoundaryWalls()
    {
        // Check for prerequisite BoundaryConfig
        // Create parent container GameObject
        // Create individual wall GameObjects with components
        // Configure colliders and positioning
        // Set up hierarchy and naming
        Debug.Log("âœ… Boundary Walls created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Boundary Walls", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateBoundaryWalls()
    {
        // Return false if walls already exist
        // Validate BoundaryConfig prerequisite exists
        return GameObject.Find("Boundary System") == null;
    }
}
#endif
```

**Error Handling Requirements:**

- Log clear success/failure messages with specific details
- Handle missing BoundaryConfig by creating placeholder or showing clear error
- Validate all GameObject and component creation completed successfully
- Provide actionable instructions for manual fixes if automated setup fails

## **6. ADDITIONAL DELIVERABLES** *(Task-Specific Instructions)*

### **Terminal Summary:**

- Generate detailed console output summarizing GameObjects created and their positioning
- Provide instructions on how to verify wall positioning and collider setup
- Explain next steps for physics material application and testing

### **Documentation:**

- Create brief .md file capturing GameObject hierarchy and component setup
- Document wall positioning calculations and camera bounds integration
- Include troubleshooting guide for common positioning issues

### **Custom Instructions:**

- Create walls as children of parent container for easy scene management
- Use consistent naming convention: "TopWall", "LeftWall", "RightWall"
- Add appropriate tags for wall identification in collision detection

## **7. SUCCESS CRITERIA** *(When You're Done)*

### **Core Functionality:**

- [ ] Boundary walls are created as invisible GameObjects with properly configured Collider2D components
- [ ] Wall positioning accurately defines playfield perimeter based on camera bounds and configuration
- [ ] Each boundary type (top, left, right) is created with appropriate dimensions and placement
- [ ] Boundary GameObjects are properly organized in scene hierarchy for easy management and debugging

### **Integration Tests:**

- [ ] Walls can be moved and resized through Inspector modification
- [ ] Camera bounds changes correctly update wall positioning when recalculated

### **Quality Gates:**

- [ ] No compilation errors
- [ ] Follows Unity best practices and Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] BoundaryWall class is focused on GameObject and collider management only
- [ ] Proper GameObject hierarchy with descriptive names

## **8. RESILIENCE FLAGS** *(Implementation Modifiers)*

**StubMissingDeps:** true - create basic wall setup if BoundaryConfig missing
**ValidationLevel:** Basic - validate GameObject creation and component attachment
**Reusability:** Reusable - system works for any boundary configuration

## **CONSTRAINTS & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Unity Best Practices:**

- Cache Collider2D component references during initialization
- Use BoxCollider2D for simple rectangular wall shapes
- Set colliders as triggers = false for solid collision walls
- Position walls using Transform.position for precise placement

### **Performance Requirements:**

- Static colliders for optimal physics performance (never move during gameplay)
- Minimal GameObject overhead with only necessary components
- Efficient collision detection with properly sized colliders

### **Architecture Pattern:**

Component pattern with MonoBehaviour for Unity GameObject integration

## **DEPENDENCY HANDLING**

**Missing Dependencies:**
- **If BoundaryConfig is missing:** Create stub configuration with default values for 16:10 aspect ratio
- **If Camera is missing:** Log clear error with instructions to set up main camera first
- **If Physics2D disabled:** Show error message about enabling 2D Physics in project settings

**Fallback Behaviors:**

- Use default wall dimensions if configuration is incomplete
- Log informative warnings for positioning issues
- Create walls with basic colliders even if advanced configuration fails
