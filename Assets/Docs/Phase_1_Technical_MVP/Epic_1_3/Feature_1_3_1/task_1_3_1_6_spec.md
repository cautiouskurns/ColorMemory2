# **TASK 1.3.1.6: Resolution Scaling and Aspect Ratio Management** *(Medium Complexity - 50 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.1.6 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Resolution, Scaling, Aspect Ratio, Adaptation |
| **Dependencies** | Camera bounds integration (Task 1.3.1.4) and boundary positioning system |
| **Deliverable** | ResolutionScalingManager with aspect ratio maintenance |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** ResolutionScalingManager GameObject with scaling management component
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Scaling manager in root level for global resolution handling
- **Components:** ResolutionScalingManager MonoBehaviour with resolution detection and scaling
- **System Connections:** Updates boundary system when resolution changes, maintains 16:10 aspect ratio

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Gameplay area maintains consistent 16:10 aspect ratio across different screen resolutions and sizes
- [ ] Boundary walls scale and position correctly to maintain proper game area dimensions
- [ ] Resolution changes during gameplay update boundary system without disrupting ball physics
- [ ] Scaling system preserves gameplay balance and ball physics consistency across all supported resolutions

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create ResolutionScalingManager that detects screen resolution and calculates scaling factors for 16:10 maintenance
- Implement boundary scaling logic that adjusts wall positions and dimensions based on resolution scaling
- Add aspect ratio enforcement system that ensures gameplay area maintains 16:10 regardless of screen dimensions
- Include resolution change handling that updates boundary system when screen size changes during gameplay

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Resolution/ResolutionScalingManager.cs`
- Resolution detection and scaling factor calculation for 16:10 aspect ratio maintenance
- Boundary scaling logic with position and dimension adjustment based on resolution
- Aspect ratio enforcement system for consistent gameplay area
- Resolution change handling with boundary system updates

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Manager pattern for centralized resolution and scaling management
- **Performance:** Efficient scaling calculations with minimal computational overhead
- **Resilience:** Robust aspect ratio maintenance across all supported resolutions

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Resolution/ResolutionScalingManager.cs` - Resolution and scaling management system
- Integration with camera bounds and boundary positioning from Task 1.3.1.4
