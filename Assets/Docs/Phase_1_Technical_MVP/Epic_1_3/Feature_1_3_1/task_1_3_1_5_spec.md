# **TASK 1.3.1.5: Wall Collision Audio Integration** *(Medium Complexity - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.1.5 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Audio, Collision, Sound Effects, Arcade Feel |
| **Dependencies** | Physical boundary walls with collision detection (Task 1.3.1.2) |
| **Deliverable** | BoundaryAudioSystem with collision sound triggering |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Audio system GameObject with AudioSource components for sound playback
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Audio system organized under boundary management container
- **Components:** BoundaryAudioSystem MonoBehaviour with AudioSource pool management
- **System Connections:** Detects collisions from boundary walls and triggers audio feedback

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Wall collisions trigger appropriate audio feedback immediately upon ball contact
- [ ] Audio system handles multiple simultaneous collisions without audio conflicts or performance issues
- [ ] Sound effects provide satisfying arcade-style feedback that enhances gameplay feel
- [ ] Audio configuration allows for easy adjustment of volume, pitch, and effect selection during development

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create BoundaryAudioSystem that detects collision events between ball and boundary walls
- Implement audio triggering logic with proper sound effect selection based on collision type and intensity
- Add audio source management with pooling for multiple simultaneous wall collision sounds
- Include audio configuration system for volume, pitch variation, and sound effect customization

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryAudioSystem.cs`
- Collision detection integration with boundary walls
- Audio triggering logic with collision type and intensity analysis
- AudioSource pooling system for simultaneous collision handling
- Audio configuration with volume, pitch variation, and effect customization

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern for collision detection with audio response
- **Performance:** Efficient audio pooling with minimal memory allocation
- **Resilience:** Robust audio system with configuration flexibility

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryAudioSystem.cs` - Audio system for boundary collisions
- Integration with boundary collision detection from Task 1.3.1.2
