### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.1.7 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Utility |
| **Tags** | Validation, Testing, Edge Cases, Quality Assurance |
| **Dependencies** | Complete boundary system with all previous components (Tasks 1.3.1.1-1.3.1.6) |
| **Deliverable** | BoundaryValidationSystem with edge case testing and reliability tools |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Validation system GameObject with testing and debugging components
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Validation tools organized under testing/debug container
- **Components:** BoundaryValidationSystem MonoBehaviour with testing and debugging utilities
- **System Connections:** Validates entire boundary system functionality and provides debugging tools

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Validation system confirms no ball escape issues occur even at maximum ball speeds and unusual collision angles
- [ ] Edge case testing verifies reliable collision detection for corner impacts and rapid direction changes
- [ ] Boundary escape detection provides early warning for potential collision system failures
- [ ] Debugging tools enable easy verification of boundary system reliability during development and testing

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create BoundaryValidationSystem that tests collision accuracy and boundary integrity under various conditions
- Implement edge case testing including high-speed ball collisions, corner impacts, and simultaneous multi-wall hits
- Add boundary escape detection system that monitors for ball position outside valid game area
- Include debugging tools for boundary visualization, collision testing, and performance monitoring

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryValidationSystem.cs`
- Collision accuracy testing and boundary integrity verification under various conditions
- Edge case testing for high-speed collisions, corner impacts, and multi-wall hits
- Boundary escape detection with position monitoring outside valid game area
- Debugging tools with visualization, collision testing, and performance monitoring

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Testing utilities pattern with comprehensive validation coverage
- **Performance:** Efficient testing without impacting normal gameplay performance
- **Resilience:** Thorough validation ensuring boundary system reliability

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryValidationSystem.cs` - Validation and testing system
- `Assets/Scripts/Debug/BoundaryDebugTools.cs` - Additional debugging utilities
- Integration with complete boundary system from all previous tasks
