# **TASK 1.3.1.2: Physical Boundary Wall Creation** *(Medium Complexity - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.1.2 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | GameObjects, Colliders, Boundaries, Positioning |
| **Dependencies** | Boundary configuration data structures (Task 1.3.1.1) |
| **Deliverable** | BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour with collider setup and positioning system |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Creates invisible wall GameObjects with Collider2D components around playfield perimeter
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Boundary walls organized under parent container for clean hierarchy management
- **Components:** BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour with Collider2D components for collision detection
- **System Connections:** Uses BoundaryConfig data for positioning and dimensions

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Boundary walls are created as invisible GameObjects with properly configured Collider2D components
- [ ] Wall positioning accurately defines playfield perimeter based on camera bounds and configuration
- [ ] Each boundary type (top, left, right) is created with appropriate dimensions and placement
- [ ] Boundary GameObjects are properly organized in scene hierarchy for easy management and debugging

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create BoundaryWall MonoBehaviour class with Collider2D component setup and positioning logic
- Implement wall creation methods for each boundary type (top, left, right) with proper dimensions
- Add wall positioning system that calculates correct placement based on camera bounds and configuration
- Include boundary GameObject organization with proper naming and hierarchy structure for debugging

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryWall.cs`
- MonoBehaviour with Collider2D component integration
- Wall creation methods for each boundary type with proper positioning
- GameObject naming conventions and hierarchy organization
- Camera bounds integration for accurate positioning calculations

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Component pattern with MonoBehaviour for Unity integration
- **Performance:** Efficient GameObject creation with minimal overhead
- **Resilience:** Robust positioning system with camera bounds integration

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryWall.cs` - Main boundary wall MonoBehaviour
- Dependencies on BoundaryConfig from Task 1.3.1.1
