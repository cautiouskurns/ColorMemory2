# **Unity C# Implementation Task: Physics Material Configuration** *(40 minutes)*

## **1. TASK METADATA** *(Project Context)*

**Task ID:** 1.3.1.3
**Category:** System
**Tags:** Physics, Materials, Collision, Bouncing
**Priority:** High

## **2. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE** *(What & Why)*

**Target System:** BoundaryPhysicsMaterial system with bounce configuration
**Game Context:** Breakout game requiring arcade-style ball bouncing off boundary walls with consistent energy and predictable angles

**Purpose:** Configures physics materials and collision behavior to ensure consistent ball bouncing off boundary walls without inappropriate energy loss, providing arcade-style gameplay feel.
**Complexity:** Medium - requires PhysicsMaterial2D creation, collision behavior tuning, and validation system

## **3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION** *(How to Build)*

### **Class Structure:**

```csharp
[System.Serializable]
public class BoundaryPhysicsMaterial : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Physics Configuration")]
    public PhysicsMaterial2D wallMaterial;
    public float bounciness = 1.0f;
    public float friction = 0.0f;
    
    [Header("Validation")]
    public bool enablePhysicsValidation = true;
    
    // Physics material creation and management
    // Material application system for boundary colliders
    // Bounce behavior validation and testing
}
```

### **Core Logic:**

- Create PhysicsMaterial2D assets with appropriate friction, bounciness, and combine settings
- Implement physics material application system that assigns materials to boundary colliders automatically
- Add bounce behavior configuration with energy conservation and velocity consistency for arcade feel
- Include physics validation system to test and verify bouncing behavior meets gameplay requirements

### **Dependencies:**

- BoundaryWall components from Task 1.3.1.2 (required)
- Unity Physics2D system for PhysicsMaterial2D functionality
- BoundaryConfig from Task 1.3.1.1 for material parameters
- **Fallback Strategy:** Create default physics material with standard arcade bouncing if configuration missing

### **Performance Constraints:**

- Efficient physics calculations with consistent bouncing behavior
- No runtime material modifications during gameplay
- Minimal computational overhead for collision handling

### **Architecture Guidelines:**

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle - focus only on physics material management
- Keep material configuration separate from collision detection logic
- Only implement physics material setup and application functionality
- Use Configuration pattern for physics material management

## **4. UNITY INTEGRATION** *(Where It Fits)*

**GameObject Setup:** No new GameObjects - applies physics materials to existing boundary walls
**Scene Hierarchy:** N/A for this task
**Inspector Config:** BoundaryPhysicsMaterial component with [Header] attributes for physics settings
**System Connections:** Integrates with BoundaryWall components for collision behavior, uses BoundaryConfig for parameters

## **5. RESPONSE CONTRACT** *(How AI Should Reply)*

**Required Output Format:**

1. **Implementation Plan** (4-6 bullets covering approach and key steps)
2. **Code Files** (all files in dependency order)
3. **Editor Setup Script** (always required - creates GameObjects and scene setup)
4. **Integration Notes** (brief explanation of how this integrates with other systems)

**File Structure:** 
- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/BoundaryPhysicsMaterial.cs` - Physics material management system
- `Assets/Physics/Materials/` - PhysicsMaterial2D assets for boundary collisions

**Code Standards:** Unity C# naming conventions, XML documentation for public methods, [Header] attributes for Inspector organization

### **Editor Setup Script Requirements:**

public static class CreateBoundaryPhysicsSetup
{
    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Boundary Physics")]
    public static void CreateBoundaryPhysics()
    {
        // Check for prerequisite BoundaryWall GameObjects
        // Create physics material assets folder
        // Create PhysicsMaterial2D with arcade properties
        // Apply materials to boundary wall colliders
        // Add physics management component
        Debug.Log("âœ… Boundary Physics created successfully");
    }

    [MenuItem("Breakout/Setup/Create Boundary Physics", true)]
    public static bool ValidateCreateBoundaryPhysics()
    {
        // Return false if physics materials already applied
        // Validate BoundaryWall prerequisites exist
        return GameObject.Find("Boundary System") != null;
