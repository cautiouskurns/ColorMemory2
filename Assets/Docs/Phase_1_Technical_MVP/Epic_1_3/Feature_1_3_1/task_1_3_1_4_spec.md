# **TASK 1.3.1.4: Camera Bounds Integration** *(Medium Complexity - 35 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.1.4 |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Camera, Bounds, Integration, Visual Consistency |
| **Dependencies** | Physical boundary walls (Task 1.3.1.2) and camera system setup |
| **Deliverable** | CameraBoundaryIntegration system with bounds calculation |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** No new GameObjects - integrates with existing camera and boundary systems
- **Scene Hierarchy:** N/A for this task
- **Components:** CameraBoundaryIntegration component for camera-boundary coordination
- **System Connections:** Connects camera bounds with boundary wall positioning system

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Boundary walls align perfectly with camera bounds to prevent visual inconsistencies
- [ ] Camera bounds calculation accurately determines visible game area for boundary positioning
- [ ] Boundary positioning updates correctly when camera settings or resolution changes
- [ ] Visual debugging shows clear alignment between boundaries and camera bounds for development verification

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement camera bounds calculation system that determines visible game area for boundary positioning
- Add boundary-camera alignment verification to ensure walls align with visual game area boundaries
- Create bounds update system that recalculates boundary positions when camera settings change
- Include visual debugging tools for boundary and camera bounds visualization during development

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/CameraBoundaryIntegration.cs`
- Camera bounds calculation methods for visible game area determination
- Boundary-camera alignment verification and update system
- Bounds update handling for camera settings and resolution changes
- Visual debugging tools with Gizmos for development support

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Integration pattern connecting camera and boundary systems
- **Performance:** Efficient bounds calculation with minimal computational overhead
- **Resilience:** Robust alignment system with visual debugging support

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/Boundaries/CameraBoundaryIntegration.cs` - Camera-boundary integration system
- Integration with existing BoundaryWall system from Task 1.3.1.2
