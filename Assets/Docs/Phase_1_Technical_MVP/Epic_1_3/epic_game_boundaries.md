# **EPIC 1.3: GAME BOUNDARIES** *(1.5 weeks)*

## **Epic Overview**

| Epic Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Risk Level** | Low |
| **Purpose** | Establishes the fundamental playfield containment system that defines game space boundaries, handles ball collision with walls, detects ball loss conditions, and manages ball respawn/launch mechanics essential for core gameplay loop |
| **Dependencies** | Basic Unity project setup and physics configuration |

**Playable State After Epic:** Ball bounces properly off playfield walls, falls through bottom boundary triggering life loss, respawns at paddle position, and can be launched with spacebar input - creating the essential containment and reset cycle for Breakout gameplay.

## **Feature Breakdown**

| Feature | Duration | Prerequisites | Core Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.3.1: Playfield Boundary System** | 18 hours | Unity physics setup | Creates invisible walls that contain ball movement within game area |
| **1.3.2: Death Zone Detection** | 14 hours | Boundary system complete | Detects ball loss when it falls below paddle, triggers life reduction |
| **1.3.3: Ball Reset and Launch System** | 22 hours | Death zone working | Handles ball respawn at paddle and launch mechanics with input control |

## **FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS**

### **FEATURE 1.3.1: PLAYFIELD BOUNDARY SYSTEM** *(18 hours)*

**Purpose:** Creates the physical boundaries that define the playable game area, ensuring the ball stays within the intended 16:10 aspect ratio field and bounces predictably off walls to maintain gameplay flow.

**Technical Approach:** Unity Collider2D components positioned as invisible walls around the playfield perimeter, integrated with physics system to provide consistent ball bouncing behavior without visual interference.

**Core Deliverables:**
- Boundary collision detection system with proper physics materials for consistent ball bouncing
- Playfield dimension management that adapts to different screen resolutions while maintaining 16:10 gameplay area
- Wall collision audio feedback system for arcade-style sound effects
- Integration with camera bounds to ensure consistent visual presentation
- Boundary validation system to prevent ball escape through edge cases

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Ball bounces consistently off top, left, and right boundaries without losing velocity inappropriately
- [ ] Playfield maintains proper 16:10 aspect ratio across different screen resolutions
- [ ] Wall collision produces appropriate audio feedback for arcade feel
- [ ] No ball escape issues occur even at high ball speeds or unusual collision angles
- [ ] Boundary system integrates smoothly with camera and UI layout management

### **FEATURE 1.3.2: DEATH ZONE DETECTION** *(14 hours)*

**Purpose:** Implements the bottom boundary detection system that identifies when the ball falls below the paddle, triggering life loss and maintaining the risk/reward balance essential to Breakout gameplay progression.

**Technical Approach:** Trigger zone detection system positioned below the paddle area that captures ball entry, communicates with game state management for life reduction, and provides immediate player feedback through audio-visual effects.

**Core Deliverables:**
- Death zone trigger system with reliable ball detection at bottom boundary
- Life management integration that reduces player lives and tracks game over conditions  
- Ball loss audio-visual feedback system for immediate player awareness
- Integration with scoring system for potential penalty or bonus calculations
- Death zone positioning that adapts to paddle location and playfield scaling

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Death zone reliably detects ball loss without false positives or missed detections
- [ ] Life reduction occurs immediately upon ball entering death zone with clear player feedback
- [ ] Audio-visual feedback provides satisfying "ball lost" experience matching arcade expectations
- [ ] Death zone positioning remains consistent with paddle area regardless of screen resolution
- [ ] Integration with game state management enables proper game over detection and handling

### **FEATURE 1.3.3: BALL RESET AND LAUNCH SYSTEM** *(22 hours)*

**Purpose:** Manages the ball respawn cycle and launch mechanics that allow players to continue gameplay after ball loss, providing the essential reset mechanism that maintains game flow and player agency in ball direction control.

**Technical Approach:** Ball positioning system that places ball at paddle location, input handling for spacebar launch control, physics impulse application for consistent ball launching, and visual/audio feedback for launch actions.

**Core Deliverables:**
- Ball respawn positioning system that places ball correctly relative to paddle location
- Launch input handling with spacebar detection and alternative input method support
- Ball launch physics with configurable speed and direction control for gameplay balance
- Launch trajectory visualization or feedback system for player aiming assistance
- Integration with paddle movement to maintain ball positioning during pre-launch phase
- Launch audio-visual effects that provide satisfying feedback for player actions

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Ball respawns consistently at paddle position after life loss with proper positioning
- [ ] Spacebar input launches ball reliably with appropriate physics impulse and direction control
- [ ] Ball maintains position relative to paddle during pre-launch phase allowing for aiming
- [ ] Launch trajectory feels controllable and responsive to player paddle positioning
- [ ] Launch audio-visual feedback provides satisfying arcade-style game feel
- [ ] Alternative input methods (mouse) work seamlessly with launch system for accessibility

## **Epic Integration**

**System Architecture:** The Game Boundaries epic creates a three-layer containment system where boundary walls define the playfield limits, death zone detection manages ball loss conditions, and reset/launch mechanics provide the essential gameplay loop continuation. These systems work together to create the fundamental spatial framework that all other gameplay elements depend on.

**Dependencies on Other Epics:** Requires basic Unity physics configuration and project setup. No complex dependencies on other gameplay systems, making this an ideal early development epic.

**Provides to Other Epics:** Delivers the essential playfield containment that enables all subsequent gameplay features - paddle movement stays within bounds, ball physics operate within defined space, brick placement occurs within established boundaries, and scoring/life management systems have reliable ball loss detection to trigger their functionality.
