# **TASK 1.3.2.3: Death Zone Trigger Detection System** *(Medium Complexity - 60 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.2.3 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Collision Detection, Trigger System, Ball Detection, Events |
| **Dependencies** | Death zone positioning (Task 1.3.2.2), ball GameObject with collision components |
| **Deliverable** | DeathZoneTrigger MonoBehaviour with collision detection and event system |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Death zone trigger GameObject with invisible Collider2D trigger component
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Trigger positioned at death zone location below paddle area
- **Components:** DeathZoneTrigger MonoBehaviour with Collider2D trigger and event system
- **System Connections:** Detects ball collisions and provides events for life management and feedback systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Death zone trigger reliably detects ball entry without false positives or missed detections
- [ ] Trigger system accurately identifies ball objects while ignoring other game objects
- [ ] Collision detection works consistently across different ball speeds and approach angles
- [ ] Event system provides clean integration points for life management and feedback systems

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Create invisible trigger collider with appropriate dimensions for reliable ball detection
- Implement ball identification system using tags, layers, or component detection for accurate triggering
- Add collision event system with UnityEvent or C# events for loose coupling with other systems
- Include detection validation to prevent false positives from other game objects

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/DeathZone/DeathZoneTrigger.cs`
- MonoBehaviour with Collider2D trigger component and OnTriggerEnter2D handling
- Ball identification using tags ("Ball") or layer masks for accurate detection
- Event system with UnityEvent and C# events for system integration
- Validation logic to prevent false positive triggers from non-ball objects

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern with event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- **Performance:** Efficient collision detection with proper ball identification
- **Resilience:** Robust trigger detection with validation and false positive prevention

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/DeathZone/DeathZoneTrigger.cs` - Main trigger detection MonoBehaviour
- Integration with DeathZonePositioning from Task 1.3.2.2
