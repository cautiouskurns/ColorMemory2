# **TASK 1.3.2.4: Life Management Integration** *(Medium Complexity - 50 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.2.4 |
| **Priority** | Critical |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | System |
| **Tags** | Life Management, Game State, Game Over Detection, Event Integration |
| **Dependencies** | Death zone trigger detection (Task 1.3.2.3), game state management system (can be stubbed) |
| **Deliverable** | LifeManager MonoBehaviour with life tracking and game over detection |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** LifeManager GameObject for centralized life management
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Life manager in root level or game management container
- **Components:** LifeManager MonoBehaviour with life tracking and event subscription
- **System Connections:** Subscribes to death zone trigger events, integrates with game state management and UI systems

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Life reduction occurs immediately upon ball entering death zone with accurate life counting
- [ ] Game over detection triggers correctly when lives reach zero with proper state management
- [ ] Life management integrates cleanly with game state systems without tight coupling
- [ ] Life tracking provides consistent behavior across game sessions and respawn cycles

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement life tracking system with configurable starting lives and life reduction logic
- Add death zone event subscription system that responds to ball loss triggers
- Create game over detection that triggers when lives reach zero with appropriate state management
- Include life state persistence and UI integration points for life display updates

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/GameManagement/LifeManager.cs`
- MonoBehaviour with life tracking variables and event subscription methods
- Death zone trigger event subscription with life reduction handling
- Game over detection with state management integration
- UI integration points for life display updates and game over notifications

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Manager pattern with event-driven integration for loose coupling
- **Performance:** Efficient event handling with minimal computational overhead
- **Resilience:** Robust life tracking with state persistence and recovery

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/GameManagement/LifeManager.cs` - Main life management system
- Integration with DeathZoneTrigger events from Task 1.3.2.3
