# **TASK 1.3.2.5: Ball Loss Audio-Visual Feedback System** *(Medium Complexity - 45 minutes)*

### **Task Overview**

| Task Details | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Task ID** | 1.3.2.5 |
| **Priority** | Medium |
| **Complexity** | Medium |
| **Category** | Feature |
| **Tags** | Audio Effects, Visual Effects, Feedback, Player Experience |
| **Dependencies** | Death zone trigger detection (Task 1.3.2.3), audio system, particle system (optional) |
| **Deliverable** | DeathZoneFeedback MonoBehaviour with audio-visual effects system |

### **Unity Integration**

- **GameObjects:** Feedback system GameObject with AudioSource and particle system components
- **Scene Hierarchy:** Feedback effects organized under death zone or effects container
- **Components:** DeathZoneFeedback MonoBehaviour with AudioSource, ParticleSystem, and effect coordination
- **System Connections:** Subscribes to death zone trigger events and coordinates audio-visual feedback timing

### **Task Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Audio-visual feedback provides immediate and satisfying "ball lost" experience matching arcade expectations
- [ ] Feedback timing creates appropriate dramatic pause without disrupting game flow
- [ ] Audio effects enhance gameplay tension and provide clear event confirmation
- [ ] Visual feedback draws appropriate player attention without being overwhelming or distracting

### **Implementation Specification**

**Core Requirements:**
- Implement audio feedback system with appropriate sound effects for ball loss events
- Add visual feedback using particle effects, screen flash, or UI animations for immediate player awareness
- Create feedback timing system that coordinates audio-visual effects for maximum impact
- Include feedback customization options for intensity, duration, and effect selection

**Technical Details:**
- File location: `Assets/Scripts/DeathZone/DeathZoneFeedback.cs`
- MonoBehaviour with AudioSource component and particle system integration
- Death zone trigger event subscription with feedback coordination
- Audio effect configuration with volume, pitch, and timing control
- Visual effect coordination with particle systems, screen effects, or UI animations

### **Architecture Notes**

- **Pattern:** Observer pattern with coordinated audio-visual feedback system
- **Performance:** Efficient effect triggering with pooled particle systems and audio optimization
- **Resilience:** Configurable feedback system with customizable intensity and timing

### **File Structure**

- `Assets/Scripts/DeathZone/DeathZoneFeedback.cs` - Audio-visual feedback coordination system
- Integration with DeathZoneTrigger events from Task 1.3.2.3
