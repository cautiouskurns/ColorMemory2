# **FEATURE TASK BREAKDOWN**

## **FEATURE 1.3.2: DEATH ZONE DETECTION** *(Total Duration: 14 hours)*

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**
**Purpose:** Implements the bottom boundary detection system that identifies when the ball falls below the paddle, triggering life loss and maintaining the risk/reward balance essential to Breakout gameplay progression.
**Complexity:** Medium - requires trigger detection, life management integration, audio-visual feedback, and adaptive positioning
**Main Deliverables:** Death zone trigger system, life management integration, ball loss feedback system, scoring integration, adaptive positioning

### **TASK BREAKDOWN STRATEGY**

**Breakdown Rationale:** Divided by system responsibility - starting with foundational configuration data, building positioning system for proper death zone placement, implementing core trigger detection, integrating with life management, adding feedback systems, and finally connecting with scoring mechanics.

**Task Sequencing Logic:** Configuration provides foundation, positioning establishes death zone location, trigger detection implements core functionality, life management handles game state changes, feedback provides player awareness, and scoring integration completes the system connections.

```

**Critical Dependencies:**
- **Task 1.3.2.2** requires Task 1.3.2.1 because: Positioning system needs configuration data for placement parameters and dimensions
- **Task 1.3.2.3** requires Task 1.3.2.2 because: Trigger detection needs positioned death zone area for collider placement
- **Task 1.3.2.4** requires Task 1.3.2.3 because: Life management needs trigger events to know when to reduce lives
- **Task 1.3.2.5** requires Task 1.3.2.3 because: Feedback system needs trigger events to know when to play effects
- **Task 1.3.2.6** requires Task 1.3.2.3 because: Scoring integration needs trigger events for penalty calculations

### **INTEGRATION POINTS**

**Feature Integration:** These tasks combine to create a complete death zone detection system where configuration defines behavior parameters, positioning establishes death zone location, trigger detection provides ball loss events, life management handles game state, feedback provides player awareness, and scoring integration connects with game mechanics.

**System Integration:** This feature integrates with the boundary system from Feature 1.3.1 for positioning reference, connects with paddle systems for relative placement, integrates with game state management for life tracking, and provides trigger events that Feature 1.3.3 (Ball Reset and Launch System) will use for respawn mechanics.
