# **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP: "Breakout"**

## **Project Summary**

**Game Type:** Arcade action game with physics-based ball mechanics and real-time paddle control

**Development Time:** 10-14 weeks total for solo developer

**Platform:** WebGL (Browser-based)

**Key Challenge:** Creating responsive and satisfying ball physics with reliable collision detection across paddle, bricks, and boundaries while maintaining 60fps performance

## **DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: TECHNICAL MVP** *(3-4 weeks)*

**Goal:** Prove core physics systems work technically - validate that ball bouncing, paddle control, and brick destruction mechanics can be built reliably
**Validation:** Ball physics respond correctly to paddle hits and brick collisions, collision detection works consistently, basic game boundaries function properly
**Playable State:** Player can control paddle with keyboard, ball launches and bounces realistically off paddle and walls, ball destroys bricks on contact, basic collision feedback provides satisfying impact response

**Key Epics:**

- **Core Physics Foundation:** Ball movement, paddle control, collision detection between all game objects with proper physics response
- **Basic Brick System:** Grid-based brick layout, brick destruction mechanics, collision response integration
- **Game Boundaries:** Playfield walls, death zone detection, ball reset and launch mechanics

### **PHASE 2: VERTICAL SLICE** *(2-3 weeks)*

**Goal:** Complete one full gameplay loop - prove the game is fun and engaging with proper feedback systems
**Validation:** Players can complete a full level from start to finish, understand scoring, experience challenge progression, feel satisfied with game feedback
**Playable State:** Player experiences complete level: paddle control → ball launch → brick destruction → scoring feedback → level completion → game over/restart cycle with clear win/lose states

**Key Epics:**

- **Complete Game Loop:** Level start, brick clearing, win/lose conditions, game restart functionality with smooth state transitions
- **Scoring and Feedback:** Point system, life management, basic UI display, immediate feedback for all player actions
- **Basic Level System:** Single level completion detection, simple difficulty parameters, level restart mechanics

### **PHASE 3: PLAYABLE BETA** *(3-4 weeks)*

**Goal:** All systems integrated and working together - rough but feature complete with full content scope
**Validation:** Complete 5-level progression works, all power-ups function correctly, audio enhances gameplay, full feature set operates as designed
**Playable State:** Player experiences complete game from menu to final level with all power-ups, audio feedback, visual effects, level progression, and high score tracking functioning as a cohesive arcade experience

**Key Epics:**

- **Power-Up System Integration:** All 6 power-up types working with proper collection, effects, duration, and visual feedback
- **Multi-Level Progression:** 5 levels with increasing difficulty, level transitions, different brick layouts, speed progression
- **Audio and Visual Polish:** Sound effects for all interactions, background music, particle effects, ball trail, UI animations

### **PHASE 4: RELEASE VERSION** *(2-3 weeks)*

**Goal:** Launch-ready product with polish, optimization, and final content balancing
**Validation:** 60fps WebGL performance maintained, all edge cases handled gracefully, game balance provides satisfying challenge curve, ready for public release
**Playable State:** Players experience polished arcade game with smooth performance, balanced difficulty, satisfying audio-visual feedback, intuitive controls, and professional presentation quality that encourages replay

**Key Epics:**

- **Performance Optimization:** WebGL build optimization, 60fps target achievement, memory management, object pooling implementation
- **Game Balance and Polish:** Difficulty curve refinement, power-up balancing, visual effect polish, UI/UX improvements
- **Release Preparation:** WebGL deployment testing, browser compatibility, final bug fixes, high score system validation

## **MILESTONE VALIDATION**

**Technical MVP Success:** Ball physics feel responsive and predictable, paddle control is precise, brick destruction provides satisfying feedback, collision detection works reliably at all ball speeds

**Vertical Slice Success:** Players can complete one full level naturally, understand the core game loop immediately, feel challenged but not frustrated, want to play again after game over

**Playable Beta Success:** All 5 levels provide distinct challenge progression, power-ups add strategic depth and excitement, audio-visual feedback enhances the arcade experience, game feels feature-complete

**Release Ready:** Game maintains 60fps across all browsers, difficulty curve provides 10-15 minutes of engaging gameplay, visual polish matches retro arcade aesthetic, ready for public web deployment

**Critical Path:** Ball physics and collision detection → paddle control integration → brick destruction mechanics → level completion logic → power-up system → multi-level progression → performance optimization

**Biggest Risk:** Ball physics complexity could lead to inconsistent collision behavior or performance issues. Mitigation: Implement robust physics testing early in MVP phase, use Unity's proven physics components, and maintain comprehensive collision debugging tools throughout development.
