# **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP: "Color Memory"**

## **Project Summary**

**Game Type:** Memory puzzle with progressive sequence-based challenges

**Development Time:** 6-8 weeks total for solo developer

**Platform:** WebGL (Browser-based)

**Key Challenge:** Creating responsive sequence generation/validation system with smooth audio-visual feedback loops

---

## **DEVELOPMENT PHASES**

### **PHASE 1: TECHNICAL MVP** *(2 weeks)*

**Goal:** Prove core systems work technically - validate that the sequence memory mechanics can be built
**Validation:** Color squares respond to clicks, basic sequence generation works, game state transitions function
**Playable State:** Player can click 4 colored squares in a 2x2 grid, system generates a 2-color sequence, player can attempt to repeat it with immediate right/wrong feedback

**Key Epics:**

- **Core Grid System:** 4 clickable ColorSquare GameObjects with distinct colors and click detection
- **Sequence Engine:** SequenceManager generates random color sequences and validates player input
- **State Machine Foundation:** GameStateManager handles basic transitions between showing sequence and player input phases

### **PHASE 2: VERTICAL SLICE** *(2 weeks)*

**Goal:** Complete one full gameplay loop - prove the game is fun and engaging
**Validation:** Players can experience complete level progression from sequence display through validation to next level
**Playable State:** Player watches system display a 2-color sequence, repeats it correctly, sees sequence grow to 3 colors, experiences failure state when wrong, can restart game

**Key Epics:**

- **Complete Game Loop:** Sequence display → player input → validation → progression/failure with smooth transitions
- **Progression System:** Level advancement with increasing sequence length, score tracking per correct sequence
- **Visual Feedback System:** Color squares highlight during sequence display, visual feedback for correct/incorrect inputs

### **PHASE 3: PLAYABLE BETA** *(2 weeks)*

**Goal:** All systems integrated and working together - rough but feature complete
**Validation:** Full 1-10 level progression, audio feedback, UI elements, high score persistence
**Playable State:** Player experiences complete game from start to victory/failure, hears unique sounds for each color, sees score progression, can beat their high score across sessions

**Key Epics:**

- **Audio Integration:** AudioManager with unique musical notes per color, success/failure sound effects
- **UI System Complete:** Score display, level indicator, restart button, game over screen with final score
- **Persistence Layer:** High score storage using PlayerPrefs, session data management

### **PHASE 4: RELEASE VERSION** *(2 weeks)*

**Goal:** Launch-ready product with polish, optimization, and final content
**Validation:** 60fps WebGL performance, responsive design, professional visual polish, error handling
**Playable State:** Players experience a polished memory game with smooth animations, professional UI, consistent 60fps performance, and satisfying audio-visual feedback that encourages repeated play

**Key Epics:**

- **Performance Optimization:** WebGL build optimization, memory management, 60fps target achievement
- **Visual Polish:** Smooth color transitions, button hover states, victory animations, professional color palette implementation
- **Platform Integration:** WebGL deployment testing, responsive design validation, error handling for browser compatibility

## **MILESTONE VALIDATION**

**Technical MVP Success:** All 4 color squares clickable, sequence generation produces random 2-color patterns, basic right/wrong validation works

**Vertical Slice Success:** Players can complete 3-4 levels in sequence, understand progression, experience failure and restart naturally

**Playable Beta Success:** Full 10-level experience playable start to finish, audio enhances gameplay, high scores persist between sessions  

**Release Ready:** Game loads in <3 seconds, maintains 60fps, handles edge cases gracefully, ready for browser deployment

**Critical Path:** ColorSquare click detection → SequenceManager validation logic → GameStateManager transitions → UI integration → Audio system → WebGL optimization

**Biggest Risk:** WebGL audio latency could break the rhythm-based memory experience. Mitigation: Test audio system early in MVP phase, have fallback visual-only mode if needed.
